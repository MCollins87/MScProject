# Discussion
Went over project proposal. 

DB main point - If you can provide the data back to Clinicians, they are more likely to enter data correctly at source. 

# Data to be captured

- Age (at diagnosis)
- Sex
- Primary tumour site
- Morphology
- Biomarkers
- Staging
- Performance Status
- Consultant
- DOD (Time from Diagnosis & time from Treatment)

These are filters to be applied to identify cohorts of patients for further audit/investigation.

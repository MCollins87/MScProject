However, enterprises face persistent challenges such as data redundancy, fragmented data systems, and non-compliance risks, which impede operational efficiency and strategic insights. This study presents a comprehensive Data Governance Framework designed to address these challenges, specifically tailored to high-impact programs operating at scale. The proposed framework integrates advanced strategies for reducing data redundancy, enhancing data quality, and ensuring regulatory compliance. Central to the framework is the application of machine learning algorithms for duplicate detection and data standardization, enabling automated identification and resolution of redundant entries across disparate systems. Additionally, the framework emphasizes the use of metadata management and data lineage tracking to provide transparency and maintain the integrity of enterprise datasets. Through centralized data stewardship roles and cross-functional governance committees, organizations can foster collaboration and accountability in maintaining data quality and compliance. This study also underscores the importance of scalable data governance policies that align with dynamic regulatory requirements and enterprise growth. Key elements include adaptive data classification protocols, real-time monitoring of data processes, and the deployment of privacy-enhancing technologies to safeguard sensitive information. The framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through case studies, showcasing significant reductions in duplicate records, streamlined data workflows, and improved compliance metrics. By refining existing governance models, this framework provides actionable insights for organizations aiming to enhance data quality at scale, reduce redundancies, and ensure compliance in complex enterprise environments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Adepoju","given":"Adebusayo Hassanat"},{"family":"Gabriel","given":"Blessing Austin-"},{"family":"Eweje","given":"Adeoluwa"},{"family":"Hamza","given":"Oladimeji"}],"citation-key":"adepoju2023","container-title":"International Journal of Multidisciplinary Research and Growth Evaluation","container-title-short":"IJMRGE","DOI":"10.54660/.IJMRGE.2023.4.6.1141-1154","ISSN":"25827138","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"1141–1154","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"A data governance framework for high-impact programs: Reducing redundancy and enhancing data quality at scale","title-short":"A data governance framework for high-impact programs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.allmultidisciplinaryjournal.com/search?q=MGE-2025-1-077&search=search","volume":"4"},{"id":"aggarwal2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2026",2,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Aggarwal","given":"Ajay"},{"family":"Simcock","given":"Richard"},{"family":"Price","given":"Pat"},{"family":"Rachet","given":"Bernard"},{"family":"Lyratzopoulos","given":"Georgios"},{"family":"Walker","given":"Kate"},{"family":"Spencer","given":"Katie"},{"family":"Roques","given":"Tom"},{"family":"Sullivan","given":"Richard"}],"citation-key":"aggarwal2024","container-title":"The Lancet Oncology","container-title-short":"The Lancet Oncology","DOI":"10.1016/S1470-2045(24)00345-0","ISSN":"1470-2045, 1474-5488","issue":"8","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8,1]]},"language":"English","page":"e363-e373","PMID":"38991599","publisher":"Elsevier","source":"www.thelancet.com","title":"NHS cancer services and systems—ten pressure points a UK cancer control plan needs to address","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(24)00345-0/fulltext","volume":"25"},{"id":"ahmad2023","abstract":"In this savvy world of technology, most consumers want something that is quick, convenient, and can fulfill their needs. Hence, it is parallel to the businesses nowadays that have the tendency to use online platforms to market their products. Thus, social media becomes one of the most popular online selling mediums among business firms. In a social media marketing strategy, one of the most important elements that needs to be highlighted by the firm is the content marketing itself. In other words, to succeed in a social media marketing strategy, it is necessary for the firm to provide high-quality content marketing for consumers. Considering that nowadays most consumers in the world use social media as one of the mediums through which they shop, the author suggests Social Media Content Marketing (SMCM) plays a role in influencing consumer behaviour. Social media will work more effectively if the content marketing displayed is of high quality and meets the needs of consumers who buy online. Therefore, this SMCM model is one of the digital marketing strategies that need to be emphasized in online marketing, which in turn will have a positive impact on consumer behaviour. This paper will discuss further the SMCM on online purchases.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Ahmad","given":"Nur Syakirah"},{"family":"Rosli","given":"Rozaini"}],"citation-key":"ahmad2023","container-title":"Asia-Pacific Journal of Management and Technology","container-title-short":"AJMT","DOI":"10.46977/apjmt.2023.v04i01.005","ISSN":"26526840","issue":"01","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"35–41","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Role of Social Media Content Marketing (SMCM) as a Digital Marketing Strategy towards the Internal Factors of Consumer Behavior among the Millennials","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ejournal.lincolnrpl.org/index.php/ajmt/article/view/127","volume":"04"},{"id":"al-badi2018","abstract":"The recent explosion in ICT and digital data has led organizations, both private and public, to efficient decision-making.

Big Data emergence provides great convenience, but it also brings challenges. Nevertheless, for Big Data governance, data has to be prepared in a timely manner, keeping in view the consistency and reliability of the data, and being able to trust its source and the meaningfulness of the result. Hence, a framework for Big Data governance would have many advantages. There are Big Data governance frameworks, which guide the management of Big Data. However, there are also limitations associated with these frameworks.

Advanced collaboration technologies support companies in synchronizing their joint actions by forming digital business ecosystems (DBE). While such technologies are beneficial to companies, their use might also be potentially detrimental due to the increased complexity they add to the management of the BDE partners' collaboration and due to the partners' lack of knowledge in coping with this complexity. For companies to deal with the complexities in their dynamic environments, they need approaches for mapping out and analyzing their DBEs. Due to the newness of the DBE concept, how to model and analyze DBEs is hardly known. Yet, this is necessary, as partners in a DBEs want to know if their DBEs promotes or prohibits profit. This article proposes an approach to modelling and analyzing DBEs, based on the complimentary use of ArchiMate standards and quantitative methods such as the Analytical Hierarchy Process and linear programming. We carried out a first evaluation of the proposed approach by using an expert panel of practitioners. Our results indicate that the approach is easy to use from practitioner's perspective and that it can assist practitioners in executing their modelling and analysis tasks. However, more empirical evaluation research is needed in order to improve the approach's applicability in supporting companies in making DBE-related decisions.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,6]]},"author":[{"family":"Aldea","given":"Adina"},{"family":"Kusumaningrum","given":"Marcella Cindy"},{"family":"Iacob","given":"Maria Eugenia"},{"family":"Daneva","given":"Maya"}],"citation-key":"aldea2018","container-title":"2018 IEEE 20th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","DOI":"10.1109/CBI.2018.10064","event-title":"2018 IEEE 20th Conference on Business Informatics (CBI)","ISSN":"2378-1971","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",7]]},"page":"156–163","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Modeling and Analyzing Digital Business Ecosystems: An Approach and Evaluation","title-short":"Modeling and Analyzing Digital Business Ecosystems","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8453950/","volume":"02"},{"id":"alkhatib2025","abstract":"This paper comprehensively analyzes three leading cloud computing platforms: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

This goal has forced organizations to evolve their development processes. We report on a study that we conducted on observing software teams at Microsoft as they develop AI-based applications. We consider a nine-stage workflow process informed by prior experiences developing AI applications (e.g., search and NLP) and data science tools (e.g. application diagnostics and bug reporting). We found that various Microsoft teams have united this workflow into preexisting, well-evolved, Agile-like software engineering processes, providing insights about several essential engineering challenges that organizations may face in creating large-scale AI solutions for the marketplace. We collected some best practices from Microsoft teams to address these challenges. In addition, we have identified three aspects of the AI domain that make it fundamentally different from prior software application domains: 1) discovering, managing, and versioning the data needed for machine learning applications is much more complex and difficult than other types of software engineering, 2) model customization and model reuse require very different skills than are typically found in software teams, and 3) AI components are more difficult to handle as distinct modules than traditional software components - models may be \"entangled\" in complex ways and experience non-monotonic error behavior. We believe that the lessons learned by Microsoft teams will be valuable to other organizations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Amershi","given":"Saleema"},{"family":"Begel","given":"Andrew"},{"family":"Bird","given":"Christian"},{"family":"DeLine","given":"Robert"},{"family":"Gall","given":"Harald"},{"family":"Kamar","given":"Ece"},{"family":"Nagappan","given":"Nachiappan"},{"family":"Nushi","given":"Besmira"},{"family":"Zimmermann","given":"Thomas"}],"citation-key":"amershi2019","container-title":"2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","DOI":"10.1109/ICSE-SEIP.2019.00042","event-title":"2019 IEEE/ACM 41st International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",5]]},"page":"291–300","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Software Engineering for Machine Learning: A Case Study","title-short":"Software Engineering for Machine Learning","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8804457"},{"id":"anggraini2019","abstract":"Cloud computing is the latest paradigm that many private and public agencies have shown a significant interest in enabling the technology.

This has given rise to a hybrid approach in which enterprises retain the dynamic choice to leverage private data centers and one or more public clouds in conjunction. While cloud service providers (CSPs) have long provided APIs for estimating, reconciling, and optimizing operating costs, they have only recently started exposing APIs related to CFP.Indeed, this is a step in the right direction. Nevertheless, our analyses of these APIs reveals many gaps that need to be addressed to facilitate sizing and placement decisions that can factor in carbon. First, there is a lack of standardized, transparent methodology for CFP quantification across different CSPs. Second, the coarse granularity of the CFP data provided today can help with post-facto reporting but is not suitable for proactive fine-grained optimization. Last, enterprises themselves are unable to independently compute the current CFP or estimate potential CFP savings since CSPs do not share the required power usage data.To address these gaps, enterprises have started developing their own carbon assessment methodologies and tools to estimate the CFP of workloads running on public clouds using the available user-facing APIs. These systems hold the promise for an independent and unbiased evaluation and estimation of relative savings between different deployment options by cloud users. We describe and analyze the details of CSP-native carbon-reporting tools and their quantification methodology, and the \"outside-of-the-cloud\" estimation approaches. Finally, we present opportunities for future research in the direction of trustworthy, fine-grained, public cloud workload CFP estimation, which is a prerequisite for meaningful realization of carbon optimization.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Arora","given":"Rohan"},{"family":"Devi","given":"Umamaheswari"},{"family":"Eilam","given":"Tamar"},{"family":"Goyal","given":"Aanchal"},{"family":"Narayanaswami","given":"Chandra"},{"family":"Parida","given":"Pritish"}],"citation-key":"arora2023","collection-title":"HotCarbon '23","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Sustainable Computer Systems","DOI":"10.1145/3604930.3605721","ISBN":"979-8-4007-0242-6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,2]]},"page":"1–7","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Towards Carbon Footprint Management in Hybrid Multicloud","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3604930.3605721"},{"id":"ashraf2024","abstract":"The online pharmacy market is growing, with legitimate online pharmacies offering advantages such as convenience and accessibility.

It establishes a number of points of departure when considering the issue of workplace surveillance, before reviewing some of the more critical issues. First, it establishes that organizations and surveillance go hand in hand; and that workplace surveillance can take social and technological forms. Personal data gathering, Internet and email monitoring, location tracking, biometrics and covert surveillance are all areas of development. There is also evidence that groups of employees are appropriating information and communication technologies to stare back at their employers, exposing unsavoury practices and organizing collectively, prompting new thinking about resistance. Organizations watch employees primarily to protect their assets, although the nature and intensity of surveillance says much about how a company views its employees. Workplace surveillance has consequences for employees, affecting employee well-being, work culture, productivity, creativity and motivation. If no alternative can be found, managerial attention to task design, supervisory processes, employees’ expectations about monitoring, and an appraisal of the company's operating environment can mediate its downsides. It is argued that in many ways the normality of workplace surveillance, and the prevalence of arguments about how to ‘do it better’, make it difficult to radicalize. As part of what is seen as ‘good’ management practice, it can confer benefits on the employee if conducted in a humane, balanced way, and is considered on a case-by-case–organization-by-organization–basis. However, the introduction of broader debates around information use, rights, power and social structure highlights how surveillance in the workplace may serve to perpetuate existing inequalities and create new ones.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Ball","given":"Kirstie"}],"citation-key":"ball2010","container-title":"Labor History","DOI":"10.1080/00236561003654776","ISSN":"0023-656X","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2010",2,1]]},"page":"87–106","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Workplace surveillance: an overview","title-short":"Workplace surveillance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/00236561003654776","volume":"51"},{"id":"banerjee1987","abstract":"Object-oriented programming is well-suited to such data-intensive application domains as CAD/CAM, AI, and OIS (office information systems) with multimedia documents.

Findings show that brand-related content allows users to share their perceived experiential benefits with their networks, ultimately reinforcing the brand’s experiential and symbolic dimensions. Moreover, user content influences one’s perception of value and attitude. However, if the sense of social homophily and membership is evident, diminishing a brand’s perceived value through brand dilution is unlikely. While previous studies revising the outcomes of online exposure for luxury firms have primarily focused on firm-controlled messages, this investigation acknowledges the importance of brand communities in creating and spreading brand-related content and their effect on luxury appeals.

Using a logdriven experimental technique, this paper gives a comparative evaluation of two leading Integrated Containerization (IaC) solutions, namely Terraform and Amazon Web Services CloudFormation. Both tools were used to provision identical Amazon Web Services environments, and a total of 110 controlled deployment iterations were carried out for both of them under circumstances that were consistent. Key performance indicators, such as the percentage of successful deployments, the amount of time it takes to provision, and the number of times errors occur, were gathered from the logs that were generated by the system. According to the findings, both tools have a high degree of dependability, as evidenced by the fact that the overall deployment success rate is 94.55% and the bulk of deployments (80%) are completed within ten minutes. There were very few instances of failures occurring, with 87.27 percent of deployments operating without any faults. In addition to highlighting the operational efficiency and stability of both Terraform and CloudFormation, these findings also provide empirical insights that can assist cloud architects in picking the installation and configuration tool that is the most appropriate for their particular deployment requirements.","author":[{"family":"Bavadiya","given":"Pathik"}],"citation-key":"bavadiya2021","container-title":"International Journal of Innovation Studies","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","source":"Zotero","title":"OPTIMIZING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENTS USING INFRASTRUCTURE AS CODE: A COMPARATIVE STUDY OF TERRAFORM AND CLOUDFORMATION","type":"article-journal","volume":"5"},{"id":"bcs2021","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,20]]},"author":[{"literal":"BCS"}],"citation-key":"bcs2021","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"title":"BCS Code of Conduct for members - Ethics for IT professionals | BCS","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.bcs.org/membership-and-registrations/become-a-member/bcs-code-of-conduct"},{"id":"beard2021","abstract":"Contemporary practitioners of content marketing (CM) often suggest their discipline is an ancient one, yet mainly limit its origins to the custom-published magazines of the late 1800s. The purpose of this paper is to synthesize some of the many definitions of CM and to report the first scholarly history of its development and practice.This study’s purposes led to the following research questions: To what extent were CM strategies and tactics used before the 20th century? How have the uses and characteristics of CM changed or remained the same over time? Sources included general histories focusing on the earliest uses of advertising and promotions and edited book chapters and journal articles on the histories of branding and early print advertising, marketing and advertising practices in ancient and medieval periods and the development of consumer cultures around the world.Research findings support three conclusions: CM existed much earlier than often acknowledged; has emerged as a unique marketing discipline, strategically and tactically distinguishable from the others (e.g. advertising and sales promotion); and possesses objectives, strategies and tactics that have remained remarkably consistent in practice across the millennia.The research supports several insights to the history of marketing and the practice of CM. Some of the CM strategies and tactics identified in this paper, for instance, have previously been concluded to be part of advertising’s history. Findings also reveal that many of advertising’s American pioneers actually used CM to persuade 19th-century businessmen to adopt widespread advertising. In addition, the emphasis on interactive, digital media in CM definitions offers a likely explanation for the recent enthusiasm behind CM as a response to global trends in consumer preferences and global competition, as well as why contemporary CM practitioners have often failed to recognize they are practicing a “new” discipline that has actually been in use for thousands of years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,12]]},"author":[{"family":"Beard","given":"Fred"},{"family":"Petrotta","given":"Brian"},{"family":"Dischner","given":"Ludwig"}],"citation-key":"beard2021","container-title":"Journal of Historical Research in Marketing","container-title-short":"Journal of Historical Research in Marketing","DOI":"10.1108/JHRM-10-2020-0052","ISSN":"1755-750X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,31]]},"page":"139–158","source":"Silverchair","title":"A history of content marketing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JHRM-10-2020-0052","volume":"13"},{"id":"bhuyan2021","abstract":"Transport operators have a range of intervention options available to improve or enhance their networks. Such interventions are often made in the absence of sound evidence on resulting outcomes. Cycling superhighways were promoted as a sustainable and healthy travel mode, one of the aims of which was to reduce traffic congestion. Estimating the impacts that cycle superhighways have on congestion is complicated due to the nonrandom assignment of such intervention over the transport network. In this paper we analyse the causal effect of cycle superhighways utilising preintervention and postintervention information on traffic and road characteristics along with socioeconomic factors. We propose a modeling framework based on the propensity score and outcome regression model. The method is also extended to the doubly robust set-up. Simulation results show the superiority of the performance of the proposed method over existing competitors. The method is applied to analyse a real dataset on the London transport network. The methodology proposed can assist in effective decision making to improve network performance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bhuyan","given":"Prajamitra"},{"family":"McCoy","given":"Emma J."},{"family":"Li","given":"Haojie"},{"family":"Graham","given":"Daniel J."}],"citation-key":"bhuyan2021","container-title":"The Annals of Applied Statistics","DOI":"10.1214/21-AOAS1450","ISSN":"1932-6157, 1941-7330","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",12]]},"page":"1999–2022","publisher":"Institute of Mathematical Statistics","source":"Project Euclid","title":"Analysing the causal effect of London cycle superhighways on traffic congestion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-applied-statistics/volume-15/issue-4/Analysing-the-causal-effect-of-London-cycle-superhighways-on-traffic/10.1214/21-AOAS1450.full","volume":"15"},{"id":"bialkova2022","abstract":"Although Augmented reality (AR) implication has increased in the cosmetic industry, the technology seems to not be always accepted and used by consumers.

Present paper addresses this challenge in an attempt to provide the needed understanding on the key drivers of AR experience and how these might enhance the consumer purchase experience itself. After trying a product via virtual try-on, participants in the current study had to provide evaluation in terms of both AR and purchase experience. The results are clear in showing that interactivity, realism, ease of use and immersion modulate AR experience evaluation and thus, the user satisfaction. Purchase experience correlated with utilitarian and hedonic values, predetermined by aesthetic and information quality. Utilitarian and hedonic values also affected the product knowledge. These relationships were well pronounced for participants reporting high satisfaction with the experience. Current outcomes are discussed further in a single framework combining various factors to provide the much-needed understanding on AR environments and their effect on consumer experience evaluation. Results could find a direct application in practices to design AR environments to augment consumer satisfaction and thus, enhancing the purchase journey.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Bialkova","given":"Svetlana"},{"family":"Barr","given":"Chloe"}],"citation-key":"bialkova2022","container-title":"2022 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops (VRW)","DOI":"10.1109/VRW55335.2022.00059","event-title":"2022 IEEE Conference on Virtual Reality and 3D User Interfaces Abstracts and Workshops (VRW)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",3]]},"page":"01–08","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Virtual Try-On: How to Enhance Consumer Experience?","title-short":"Virtual Try-On","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9757650"},{"id":"birkstedt2023","abstract":"Following the surge of documents laying out organizations' ethical principles for their use of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a growing demand for translating ethical principles to practice through AI governance (AIG). AIG has emerged as a rapidly growing, yet fragmented, research area. This paper synthesizes the organizational AIG literature by outlining research themes and knowledge gaps as well as putting forward future agendas.,The authors undertake a systematic literature review on AIG, addressing the current state of its conceptualization and suggesting future directions for AIG scholarship and practice. The review protocol was developed following recommended guidelines for systematic reviews and the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).,The results of the authors’ review confirmed the assumption that AIG is an emerging research topic with few explicit definitions. Moreover, the authors’ review identified four themes in the AIG literature: technology, stakeholders and context, regulation and processes. The central knowledge gaps revealed were the limited understanding of AIG implementation, lack of attention to the AIG context, uncertain effectiveness of ethical principles and regulation, and insufficient operationalization of AIG processes. To address these gaps, the authors present four future AIG agendas: technical, stakeholder and contextual, regulatory, and process. Going forward, the authors propose focused empirical research on organizational AIG processes, the establishment of an AI oversight unit and collaborative governance as a research approach.,To address the identified knowledge gaps, the authors present the following working definition of AIG: AI governance is a system of rules, practices and processes employed to ensure an organization's use of AI technologies aligns with its strategies, objectives, and values, complete with legal requirements, ethical principles and the requirements set by stakeholders. Going forward, the authors propose focused empirical research on organizational AIG processes, the establishment of an AI oversight unit and collaborative governance as a research approach.,For practitioners, the authors highlight training and awareness, stakeholder management and the crucial role of organizational culture, including senior management commitment.,For society, the authors review elucidates the multitude of stakeholders involved in AI governance activities and complexities related to balancing the needs of different stakeholders.,By delineating the AIG concept and the associated research themes, knowledge gaps and future agendas, the authors review builds a foundation for organizational AIG research, calling for broad contextual investigations and a deep understanding of AIG mechanisms.

The main objective is to clarify the types of activities and corresponding risks. Our starting point is to identify the vulnerabilities of AI models and outline how malicious actors can abuse them. Subsequently, we explore AI-enabled and AI-enhanced attacks. While we present a comprehensive overview, we do not aim for a conclusive and exhaustive classification. Rather, we provide an overview of the risks of enhanced AI application, that contributes to the growing body of knowledge on the issue. Specifically, we suggest four types of malicious abuse of AI (integrity attacks, unintended AI outcomes, algorithmic trading, membership inference attacks) and four types of malicious use of AI (social engineering, misinformation/fake news, hacking, autonomous weapon systems). Mapping these threats enables advanced reflection of governance strategies, policies, and activities that can be developed or improved to minimize risks and avoid harmful consequences. Enhanced collaboration among governments, industries, and civil society actors is vital to increase preparedness and resilience against malicious use and abuse of AI.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,23]]},"author":[{"family":"Blauth","given":"Taís Fernanda"},{"family":"Gstrein","given":"Oskar Josef"},{"family":"Zwitter","given":"Andrej"}],"citation-key":"blauth2022","container-title":"IEEE Access","DOI":"10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3191790","ISSN":"2169-3536","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"page":"77110–77122","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Artificial Intelligence Crime: An Overview of Malicious Use and Abuse of AI","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence Crime","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9831441","volume":"10"},{"id":"bocchi2024","abstract":"The Storage Group in the CERN IT Department operates several Ceph storage clusters with an overall capacity exceeding 100 PB.

This method generates different search results mainly through the user's operation on different search topics.

First, traditional personal search methods need to record search and click records for individual users. However, these records have great personal privacy issues for users; especially in recent years, there have been personal privacy leaks that occurred in many large online companies (such as Facebook and Yahoo). Secondly, because different users need to record their own search records, the size of the storage space is closely related to the number of users and the amount of search records stored. However, the sum of individual users' search and click records is a huge storage space in today's Internet environment. To avoid these two issues for traditional personalized search methods, this study proposes a storage-free approach based on individual users operating on different search topics.

Through extensive evaluations on a wide range of benchmarks, including multi-discipline reasoning, document understanding, multi-image / video understanding, real-world comprehension, multimodal hallucination detection, visual grounding, multilingual capabilities, and pure language processing, InternVL 2.5 exhibits competitive performance, rivaling leading commercial models such as GPT-4o and Claude-3.5-Sonnet. Notably, our model is the first open-source MLLMs to surpass 70% on the MMMU benchmark, achieving a 3.7-point improvement through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning and showcasing strong potential for test-time scaling. We hope this model contributes to the open-source community by setting new standards for developing and applying multimodal AI systems.

When building machine learning models, open data are often used. Although this trend is on the rise, the monetary losses since the attacks on machine learning models are also rising. Preparation is, thus, believed to be indispensable in terms of embarking upon machine learning. In this field of endeavor, machine learning models may be compromised in various ways, including poisoning attacks. Assaults of this nature involve the incorporation of injurious data into the training data rendering the models to be substantively less accurate. The circumstances of every individual case will determine the degree to which the impairment due to such intrusions can lead to extensive disruption. A modus operandi is proffered in this research as a safeguard for machine learning models in the face of the poisoning menace, envisaging a milieu in which machine learning models make use of data that emanate from numerous sources. The information in question will be presented as training data, and the diversity of sources will constitute a barrier to poisoning attacks in such circumstances. Every source is evaluated separately, with the weight of each data component assessed in terms of its ability to affect the precision of the machine learning model. An appraisal is also conducted on the basis of the theoretical effect of the use of corrupt data as from each source. The extent to which the subgroup of data in question can undermine overall accuracy depends on the estimated data removal rate associated with each of the sources described above. The exclusion of such isolated data based on this figure ensures that the standard data will not be tainted. To evaluate the efficacy of our suggested preventive measure, we evaluated it in comparison with the well-known standard techniques to assess the degree to which the model was providing accurate conclusions in the wake of the change. It was demonstrated during this test that when the innovative mode of appraisal was applied, in circumstances in which 17% of the training data are corrupt, the degree of precision offered by the model is 89%, in contrast to the figure of 83% acquired through the traditional technique. The corrective technique suggested by us thus boosted the resilience of the model against harmful intrusion.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Chiba","given":"Tomoki"},{"family":"Sei","given":"Yuichi"},{"family":"Tahara","given":"Yasuyuki"},{"family":"Ohsuga","given":"Akihiko"}],"citation-key":"chiba2021","container-title":"International Journal of Semantic Computing","container-title-short":"Int.

From 2020-2027 it is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 19.56%.\n\nMost active shoppers: Married 25-34-year-old women with an average salary buy the most jewelry.\n\nBiggest spenders: High-income people in the age group 45-54 spend the most money on jewelry, consuming $304.6 worth of jewelry every year.\n\nAverage American consumer: When it comes to shopping habits in the United States, the average American spends a modest $78.14 on jewelry each year.\n\nBest-selling jewelry: While necklaces are the best-performing jewelry category globally, women prefer earrings over other jewelry.\n\nAverage cost: Data from 117 different jewelers shows the average retail price for jewelry is $804.\n\nMarkup: 2020 &amp; 2021 data from two of the largest jewelry businesses in the world (Signet Jewelers and Tiffany &amp; Co) shows that the average markup on jewelry is 116%. That's 2.16 times the original acquisition + possible marketing cost of jewelry.\n\nMost searched: Looking at data between 2017-2022, the most searched jewelry category is rings, with engagement rings being the most popular ring-related search on Google.\n\nJewelry market size\nHow big is the jewelry market?\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global jewelry market value in 2023 is USD 340.69 billion. This number is based on 2022 end data.\n\n\nFor comparison, in 2014, the global jewelry market was valued at USD 157 billion.\nDuring the past nine years, the jewelry market value has grown by $183 billion, more than doubling in size.\n\nIn fact, these figures have made jewelry one of the fastest-growing segments in fashion during the past five years.\nLet's decode these numbers.\nHow about the online jewelry market?\nWith eCommerce sales contributing $57.4 billion, approximately 16.7% of all jewelry sales are made online.\n\nFor comparison, in 2021, online sales represented roughly 8.1% of global jewelry sales. This means that the transition from brick-and-mortar stores to eCommerce has been prevalent during the past few years.\nSince eCommerce accounts for 20.8% of all retail sales, the jewelry market has experienced a slightly slower transition online than the average product.\nThe global online jewelry market is forecast to reach $117.3 billion in size by 2027. This means that online jewelry is expected to see a compound annual growth rate of 19.56%.\nWhich country spends the most on jewelry?\nWith an expenditure of USD 111.5 billion, China buys, produces, and consumes the most jewelry.\n\n\n\nCountry\nJewelry Market Value (USD)\n% Of Total Jewelry Market\n\n\n1.

Republic of Korea\n$77.2\n\n\n\nWhat age group buys the most jewelry?\nWhen it comes to age demographics, 45-54 age group spends the most on jewelry with an average annual spend of US$304.6 per consumer.\nAnnual Jewelry Spend\n\n\nAverageAmerican\n\n\n\nAge26-41\n\n\n\nAge45-54\n\n\n\nAmericanhousehold\n\n\n\nAs for total jewelry expenditure by age group, people between the ages 25-34 are the busiest jewelry shoppers, contributing 35% of all jewelry sales globally.\nThe second-largest age group is the youth (16-24-year-olds), making up 27% of total jewelry expenditure.\n\n\nInterestingly, young people between the ages of 16 and 34 make up 62% of all jewelry buyers.\nIn contrast, the older half of the population (aged 45 and above) only make up 16% of global jewelry shoppers.\n\nAverage American jewelry expenditure annually\nAccording to the data collected between 2018-2020, the average American spends $78.14 on jewelry every year, while the average American household spends a whopping $434.3 on jewelry purchases annually.\n\n\nIn 2020, the average American spent 35% less on jewelry than during the previous year.\nDuring the four-year period of 2016-2020, the American household jewelry expenditure rose a total of 15.3%.\nAccording to the data by Trading Economics, Americans earn $27.07 in wage/hour. This means that the average American buys 2.9 working hours worth of jewelry every year.\n\nHow much do millennials spend on jewelry?\nBased on the data from the United States, the average millennial spends $203 on jewelry annually.\nThis number was calculated by multiplying the total jewelry spend in the US (average jewelry expenditure per capita in the US $78.14 x the US population count 329m) with the global jewelry spend accounted by millennials as a percentage of total spend (57%) and dividing it with the number of millennials in the US (72.1m).\n\nIn the US, the average millennial spends 157.9% more on jewelry than the average American.\nAlthough millennials account for 23% of the total world population, they make up 57% of all jewelry expenditure globally. \n\nWhat age group wears the most jewelry?\nWhen it comes to wearing jewelry, the youth and young adults are the most enthusiastic.\nThe numbers confirm the popularity of jewelry among young adults, as the 16-44 age group constitutes 82% of all jewelry purchases in the world.\nThis doesn't necessarily mean that elderly folks don't like to wear jewelry. Perhaps they simply have purchased their favorite jewelry pieces already and are now mainly focused on wearing their prized possessions.\nSources: GWI, Statista 1, Statista 2, EdahnGolan, TradingEconomics, WorldEconomicForum\nMost popular jewelry types\nWhat type of jewelry sells the most?\nAccording to the research, women are most inclined to buy earrings, while men like necklaces the most. When considering the whole population, necklaces are the top-selling jewelry category.\n\n\n87% of women say they wear earrings regularly, while 64% wear a necklace, and 47% a bracelet daily.\nSurprisingly, only approximately half of all women (53%) wear rings on a daily basis.\n\nWhat is the most popular jewelry today?\nWhen looking at the broad jewelry categories, necklaces are the most popular jewelry today.\nAccording to a 2019 study based on 1003 respondents in France, rings were the most worn jewelry type (60%) with necklaces (57%) coming in a close second.\nHere is some detailed data about jewelry popularity by category;\n\n\nNecklaces: The most popular necklace type is a solitaire pendant (64% prefer it over any other necklace style), while 66% of women prefer a separate chain and pendant, and 34% like the chain attached.\n\nEarrings: 70% of women prefer a round-cut stone on their stud earrings, and with 41% choosing 1-1.5 carats over any other stone size, the most wanted earrings are studs with 1-carat, round-cut diamond.\n\nBracelets: Tennis bracelets received the most love with 51% of women choosing them over other bracelets (bangles were the second favorite style with 26% selecting them). In addition, 47% of women prefer to wear their bracelets in stacks, while only 39% like to wear a single bracelet at a time.\n\nRings: Only 11% of jewelry-inclined women don't like to wear rings, while 52% choose statement rings and 37% band rings over other ring types.\n\nSources: DiamondNexus, Tiffany, Statista\nPricing and cost of jewelry\nHow much does jewelry cost?\nAccording to the data collected from 117 American jewelers in September 2016, the average retail price for jewelry is $804, and the median price is $350.\nConsidering the average combined gross profit margin from the two leading jewelers in the world, Signet Jewelers &amp; Tiffany and Co (recently acquired by LVMH), is 49,1%, jewelers can expect to pay $394 for the average priced jewelry item, and $172 for the median price item before listing the item for sale.\nThe 2016 study only looked at jewelry in the United States priced between $40-$10,000 and excluded engagement rings and wedding bands.\nHowever, since the vast majority of sold jewelry is made from precious metals such as gold and silver (globally priced commodities), and the two largest jewelers make up a significant part (~5%) of the global jewelry market it gives a fairly clear picture of the overall cost of jewelry worldwide.\nNow that we know how much jewelry costs, let's find out what people prefer to actually pay for their jewelry.\nHow much can you sell jewelry for?\nBased on the market data from two of the largest jewelry businesses in the world, you can expect to sell jewelry for 1.6-2.7 times its original acquisition price (including any possible marketing costs of the product).\nIn 2021, Signet Jewelers Limited sold jewelry for $7.826 billion (operating revenue), and their cost of revenue was $4.702 billion, leaving an average markup of 66.4%.\nIn 2020, Tiffany &amp; Co reported a revenue of $4.424 billion and a $1.662 billion cost of revenue, showing an average markup of 166.2%.\n\nThe combined average jewelry markup for Signet Jewelers and Tiffany &amp; Co is 116.3%. It's a 2.16 multiplier on the original total cost of revenue.\n\nHere's what a typical jewelry business pricing model looks like based on these numbers:\n(PRODUCT ACQUISITION COSTS + EXPECTED PRODUCT MARKETING COSTS PER UNIT SOLD) x 2.16\n\nIf you are thinking about starting a jewelry business, you can expect to sell your jewelry with a 60-170% markup on the original acquisition price (including possible product marketing costs).\n\n\nWhen looking at the largest and most successful jewelry businesses in the world, we can see that Tiffany &amp; Co has a 62.22% gross profit margin (2016-2020), and Signet Jewelers has a 35.98% gross profit margin from the same time period.\nSources: NationalJeweler, YahooFinance, Investing, CSIMarket, Statista 1, Statista 2, Statista 3\nJewelry trends and insights\nWhat kind of jewelry is the trendiest?\nAccording to the search trends compiled by Google, rings are the trendiest jewelry category in the world.\n\nThis is confirmed by the data from keyword planner, which suggests rings are the most searched jewelry-related topic on Google with over 2.2 million average monthly searches during 2020-2022.\nInterestingly, the second most popular jewelry category, according to keyword planner, is engagement rings with 1.8 million monthly searches on average.\n\nHow about in the US jewelry market?\nThe United Stated jewelry market mirrors the global jewelry market, meaning that the most fashionable jewelry type in the US is also rings, closely followed by earrings as the second most popular type of jewelry.\nAnother popular jewelry category today is pearls. As reported by Vogue, pearl jewelry has seen a +156% increase in searches in 2020 when compared to the previous year.\nSources: Google 1, Vogue, Google 2\nConclusion\nThat’s a wrap for my roundup of jewelry market statistics.\nThe sheer size of the jewelry market is what impressed me the most - and the fact that it's still growing. Also, the amount of data available about the global jewelry market on the internet is colossal.\nIf you didn't find something you desperately needed from my article, searching the internet for any free data or purchasing an in-depth jewelry market analysis from an authoritative source are your two best alternatives.\nFor now, thanks for reading.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"literal":"Classy Woman Collection"}],"citation-key":"classywomancollection2024","container-title":"Classy Women Collection","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",4,4]]},"language":"en","title":"Jewelry Market Statistics (2023)","type":"webpage","URL":"https://classywomencollection.com/blogs/fashion-guide/jewelry-market"},{"id":"coelho2023","abstract":"The march of industrial progress is marked by the appearance of disruptive technologies that originate revolutions with a significant social and economic impact.

This reflects an intensification and adaptation of a broader ‘behavioural turn’ in the governmentality of the UK state and the increasing sophistication of everyday government communications. Contemporary UK public policy is fusing with the powerful tools for behaviour change created by the platform economy. Operational data and associated systems of classification and profiling from public bodies are being hybridised with traditional consumer marketing profiles and then ‘projected’ onto the classification systems of the targeted advertising infrastructures. This is not simply a case of algorithms being used for sorting, surveilling, and scoring; rather this suggests that targeted interventions in the cultural and behavioural life of communities are now a core part of governmental power which is being algorithmically-driven, in combination with influencer networks, traditional forms of messaging, and frontline operational practices. We map these uses and practices of what we describe as the ‘Surveillance Influence Infrastructure’, identifying key ethical issues and implications which we believe have yet to be fully investigated or considered. What we find particularly striking is the coming-together of two separate structures of power - the governmental turn to behaviourism and prevention on one hand, and the infrastructures of targeting and influence (and their complex tertiary markets) on the other. We theorise this as a move beyond ‘nudge’ or ‘behavioural science’ approaches, towards a programme which we term ‘influence government’.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Collier","given":"Ben"},{"family":"Flynn","given":"Gemma"},{"family":"Stewart","given":"James"},{"family":"Thomas","given":"Daniel"}],"citation-key":"collier2022","container-title":"Big Data & Society","DOI":"10.1177/20539517221078756","ISSN":"2053-9517","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,1]]},"language":"EN","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Influence government: Exploring practices, ethics, and power in the use of targeted advertising by the UK state","title-short":"Influence government","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/20539517221078756","volume":"9"},{"id":"collins2025","author":[{"family":"Collins","given":"Mark"}],"citation-key":"collins2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,8]]},"publisher":"University of Essex","title":"Enterprise Data Report - Case Analysis","type":"report"},{"id":"CombodoITop2024","abstract":"A simple, web based IT Service Management tool","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"citation-key":"CombodoITop2024","genre":"PHP","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"license":"AGPL-3.0","original-date":{"date-parts":[["2018",8,23]]},"publisher":"Combodo","source":"GitHub","title":"Combodo/iTop","type":"software","URL":"https://github.com/Combodo/iTop"},{"id":"confessore2018","abstract":"Revelations that digital consultants to the Trump campaign misused the data of millions of Facebook users set off a furor on both sides of the Atlantic.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence in machines, teaching a computer to think, learn and perform tasks like a human. Some IT Service management vendors (ITSM) have started incorporating the added value of AI within their ITSM solutions. Even though the value of such initiatives is not well documented, there has been a lot of promising data that points to continued roll out of ITSM solutions integrated with AI. With little research currently being done on the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) process both within academia and industry, this article strives to address that existing gap in new knowledge especially with the advent of new AI adoption initiatives. The scope of this work includes a review of existing AI use within five major ITSM vendors with a CMDB process module. We provide a comprehensive discussion of the identified use cases and how any of these use cases can solve four main CMDB implementation challenges from our research study. The goal of the paper is to enhance the available knowledge on AI integrated CMDB as a core ITIL process that supports IT Service delivery. This is achieved by providing a comprehensive analysis of existing Artificial intelligence CMDB applications platforms.","author":[{"family":"Dande","given":"Fredrick"},{"family":"Li","given":"Xiaolong"},{"family":"Shofoluwe","given":"Musibau"},{"family":"Mcleod","given":"Alister"}],"citation-key":"dandeArtificialIntelligenceIntegration2024","event-title":"Proceedings of the Industrial Engineering and Operations Management World Congress","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,9]]},"publisher-place":"Detroit, Michigan","source":"ResearchGate","title":"Artificial Intelligence integration in IT Service Management: An ITIL configuration management process review","title-short":"Artificial Intelligence integration in IT Service Management","type":"paper-conference"},{"id":"dandeEnterpriseServiceManagement2023","abstract":"In ESM service delivery, the Configuration Management Database (CMDB) process ensures that you identify, baseline, and maintain selected components of a complete IT service, system, or product as Configuration Items, and you control changes to them by requiring formal approvals.

Generation Z is called digital natives as they have been exposed to the internet, social networks, and mobile systems from an early age. Driving intent to purchase for this target segment is crucial for brands. Hence, this study develops a model for measuring SMMA and validates the nomological model by verifying its influence on Purchase Intention. The paper uses 24 items on a five-dimensional scale for measuring SMMA for Gen Z. The items were generated from the literature review and focus group interviews. 310 responses were collected. After data cleaning, an Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) was run on 290 responses using SPSS version 27. The study revealed that SMMA is a four-dimensional construct with 20 variables. Electronic- Word Of Mouth (e- WOM), Interaction, Customisation, and Advertisements were the four dimensions. To further validate the nomological model, the impact of SMMA on the Purchase Intention (PI) of Gen Z was studied using multiple linear regression. The analysis confirmed the validity of the scale by describing the impact on PI for Gen Z. Customisation, Advertisements, and Interaction had a significant influence on Purchase Intention. The study theoretically confirms the constructs defining SMMA in line with previous research. It specifically outlines the measurement for Gen Z, practically enabling brands to identify the significant factors to focus on to capture the Gen Z market through social media marketing.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Deepika","given":"K.

Unfortunately, the COVID-19 pandemic has seriously “damaged” the hospitality industry and it has affected the digital marketing strategies of hotels. The aim of this paper is the evaluation of the most recent applications of digital marketing and especially the social media used by luxurious hotels and their guests (such as Facebook, Trip-advisor). The outcome of the research indicates that social media play a key role on the marketing of luxurious hotels. More specifically, a hotel should take into serious consideration the reviews made on social media by customers. A review can leverage a hotel but also it can doom its reputation. For this reason, the practitioners must give special attention on the reviews that the guests post on social media. The methodology of the paper is literature review. Hence, it will rely on publications. The authors have collected publications from various academic databases, such as SCOPUS, by using the appropriate keywords. The publications were selected based on how relative are with the purpose of this paper. To sum up, the hotel industry has to face a major challenge due to COVID-19 crisis. This crisis, which is an ongoing phenomenon, is expected to change the way that hotels are copying with. One of the changes that the hotel should take into consideration is which strategy will use on social media.

Consumers engage with brands on Instagram and other social media platforms to form any or all of the three CBE dimensions of emotional, cognitive, and behavioural bonds with brands. Both marketing-related and consumer-related benefits can be gained from CBE, yet much remains unknown about the consumer-related benefits and predictors of CBE. The uses and gratification theory suggests that CBE, even on social media spaces, should generate personal/consumer benefits. CBE varies digitally depending on the subject (sample), object (brand type) and context (culture/country). Thus, guided by the uses and gratification theory, we examined how much South African consumers’ involvement and innovativeness impact the three dimensions of CBE with cosmetic brands on Instagram and the resultant buying happiness. Data was quantitatively collected from 203 middle-class consumers through snowballing sampling. The structural equation modelling results revealed that consumer involvement and innovativeness positively impacted all three dimensions of CBE. Except for the cognitive CBE dimension, the affection and activation CBE dimensions significantly predicted buying happiness. The demonstration from this study that psychological benefits are gained from social media CBE should strengthen social media brand positioning and consumer-brand relationships endeavours.

It identifies four key top-level macro-themes through which digital changes in response to these developments may be investigated. First, the capability to store and analyse large quantities of digital data obviates the need for data ‘compression’ that characterises Weberian-model bureaucracies, and facilitates data de-compression in data-intensive information regimes, where the capabilities of public agencies and civil society are both enhanced. Second, the increasing capability of robotic devices have expanded the range of tasks that machines extending or substituting workers’ capabilities can perform, with implications for a reshaping of state organisation. Third, DSAI technologies allow new options for partitioning state functions in ways that can maximise organisational productivity, in an ‘intelligent centre, devolved delivery’ model within vertical policy sectors. Fourth, within each tier of government, DSAI technologies offer new possibilities for ‘administrative holism’ - the horizontal allocation of power and functions between organisations, through state integration, common capacity and needs-based joining-up of services. Together, these four themes comprise a third wave of DEG changes, suggesting important administrative choices to be made regarding information regimes, state organisation, functional allocation and outsourcing arrangements, as well as a long-term research agenda for public administration, requiring extensive and detailed analysis.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Dunleavy","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"Margetts","given":"Helen"}],"citation-key":"dunleavy2025","container-title":"Public Policy and Administration","DOI":"10.1177/09520767231198737","ISSN":"0952-0767","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",4,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"185–214","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Data science, artificial intelligence and the third wave of digital era governance","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/09520767231198737","volume":"40"},{"id":"dutta2019","abstract":"With the accelerated development in processing and storage technologies and the boom of the Internet, IT Hardware have become inexpensive, more potent and highly available than ever before.

This study contributes to the emerging literature on B-to-B SMEs digital marketing by determining the mechanism through which B-to-B SMEs may benefit from using the social media in their efforts to export.Despite the promising potential of the social media, especially for export-oriented companies, very limited attention has hitherto been paid to the relationship between the use of social media and export performance. This study attempts to fill the gap by investigating the extent to which actual use of social media impacts on the performance of exporting firms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Eid","given":"Riyad"},{"family":"Abdelmoety","given":"Ziad"},{"family":"Agag","given":"Gomaa"}],"citation-key":"eid2019","container-title":"Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing","container-title-short":"Journal of Business & Industrial Marketing","DOI":"10.1108/JBIM-04-2018-0121","ISSN":"0885-8624","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",10,18]]},"page":"284–305","source":"Silverchair","title":"Antecedents and consequences of social media marketing use: an empirical study of the UK exporting B2B SMEs","title-short":"Antecedents and consequences of social media marketing use","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/JBIM-04-2018-0121","volume":"35"},{"id":"elvik2000","abstract":"This paper discusses the current state-of-the-art with respect to impact assessment and cost-benefit analysis of measures designed to improve safety or mobility for pedestrians and cyclists.

Impacts that are not currently included in impact assessments and cost-benefit analyses are: (a) changes in the amount of walking and cycling; (b) changes in travel time for pedestrians and cyclists; (c) changes in road user insecurity (feeling of safety); and (d) changes in road user health state. In order to include these effects in impact assessments and cost-benefit analyses, more needs to be known about their occurrence and monetary value. Hypothetical examples of ideally designed cost-benefit analyses are given, based on highly preliminary monetary values for travel time, insecurity and generalised costs of travel for pedestrians and cyclists. These analyses indicate that inclusion of these effects in cost-benefit analyses could make a major difference for the results of those analyses.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Elvik","given":"Rune"}],"citation-key":"elvik2000","container-title":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","container-title-short":"Accident Analysis & Prevention","DOI":"10.1016/S0001-4575(99)00046-9","ISSN":"0001-4575","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2000",1,1]]},"page":"37–45","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Which are the relevant costs and benefits of road safety measures designed for pedestrians and cyclists?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001457599000469","volume":"32"},{"id":"emon2025","abstract":"This study explores the key variables influencing the adoption of AI image generators in marketing in Bangladesh, emphasizing the mediated impact of perceived usefulness. The study examines the present extent of AI image generator use across marketing agencies in Bangladesh and offers suggestions for optimizing their application to enhance efficiency, creativity, and competitiveness. A quantitative research strategy was used, gathering primary data via a standardized questionnaire administered to 480 marketing experts. Following the screening process, 320 replies were considered valid. Convenience sampling was used, focusing on professionals engaged in choices about the implementation of AI image generators. The data was analyzed using Smart PLS, a statistical program for SEM, to investigate the connections between key components and behavioral intents. Research demonstrates that PE, EE, SI, FC, and ATT substantially affect the motivation to use AI image generators. Nonetheless, PR exerts no substantial influence. PU mediators the associations between PE, SI, and PR with BI, but it does not mediate EE, FC, or ATT. The research underscores the critical importance of perceived usefulness to boosting adoption. This study offers actionable insights for marketing companies, highlighting the need to augment perceived usefulness by showcasing the advantages of AI. It enhances the comprehension of AI adoption in developing areas, facilitating digital transformation. This research is novel in its contextual emphasis on Bangladesh and its use of perceived usefulness as a mediating variable.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Emon","given":"Md Mehedi Hasan"}],"citation-key":"emon2025","container-title":"Telematics and Informatics Reports","container-title-short":"Telematics and Informatics Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.teler.2025.100267","ISSN":"2772-5030","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,1]]},"page":"100267","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Digital transformation in emerging markets: Adoption dynamics of AI image generation in marketing practices","title-short":"Digital transformation in emerging markets","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2772503025000817","volume":"20"},{"id":"engblom2025","abstract":"This study focuses on the analysis of videos posted by young girls on a social media platform, with a specific emphasis on videos featuring the sale of jewellery.

To what extent is it possible to optimize over time the resources allocated to positioning a brand on search engines? Often keyword costs are understood as monetary costs and the literature on keyword auctions suggests convergence towards a long-run equilibrium expenditure path. However, search engine optimization techniques, associated with implicit costs, have mainly focused on the short run. This paper suggests drawing long-term inferences from estimated cost per click, as the economic cost of organic keywords.

It provides a seamless and integrated customer experience across all available communication channels. MSMEs play a crucial role in developing economies, but their journey towards omnichannel integration faces significant challenges due to limited resources, managerial commitment, and technological adaptability. This study explores the stages of transformation towards omnichannel adoption among micro, small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) in fashion and furniture, as representative subsectors of Indonesia's creative economy, focusing on the dynamic capabilities. This research addresses the gap in understanding how different MSMEs navigate these challenges through various stages of transformation. Using a multiple case study approach, the research investigates two MSMEs in fashion and furniture industries through in-depth interviews and document analysis. Findings reveal that fashion MSMEs leverage real-time inventory management and personalized customer engagement for rapid integration, whereas furniture MSMEs adopt incremental approaches focused on logistical efficiency and collaboration with external partners. By emphasizing sector-specific applications of dynamic capabilities—sensing, seizing, and transforming—this study underscores the importance of collaborative alliances and leadership in addressing operational challenges. Practical implications include strategies for MSMEs to enhance competitiveness through tailored omnichannel solutions. These insights offer practical implications for MSMEs aiming to enhance their competitive edge through omnichannel strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Febriani","given":"Atik"},{"family":"Sopha","given":"Bertha Maya"},{"family":"Arif Wibisono","given":"Muhammad"}],"citation-key":"febriani2025","container-title":"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","container-title-short":"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","DOI":"10.1016/j.joitmc.2025.100498","ISSN":"2199-8531","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",3,1]]},"page":"100498","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Dynamic capabilities for omnichannel transformation in MSMEs: A comparative case study of fashion and furniture sectors","title-short":"Dynamic capabilities for omnichannel transformation in MSMEs","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2199853125000332","volume":"11"},{"id":"feversaniLightweightFrameworkService2023","abstract":"Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) are currently immersed in Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity and Ambiguity (VUCA) environments and need to adapt and innovate both their services and their management practices and processes.

To create the Menlo Report, authors and funders relied on bricolage work with existing, available resources, which significantly shaped both the report’s contents and impacts. Report authors were motivated by both forward- and backward-looking goals: enabling new data-sharing as well as addressing past controversies and their implications for the field’s body of research. Authors also grappled with uncertainty about which ethical frameworks were appropriate and made the decision to classify much network data as human subjects data. Finally, the Menlo Report authors attempted to enrol multiple existing networks in governance through appeals to local research communities as well as taking steps towards federal rulemaking. The Menlo Report serves as a case study in how to study ethics governance in the making: with attention to resources, adaptation, and bricolage, and with a focus on both the uncertainties the process tries to repair, as well as the new uncertainties the process uncovers, which will become the site of future ethics work.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,20]]},"author":[{"family":"Finn","given":"Megan"},{"family":"Shilton","given":"Katie"}],"citation-key":"finn2023","container-title":"Social Studies of Science","container-title-short":"Soc Stud Sci","DOI":"10.1177/03063127231151708","ISSN":"0306-3127","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"EN","page":"315–340","publisher":"SAGE Publications Ltd","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Ethics governance development: The case of the Menlo Report","title-short":"Ethics governance development","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/03063127231151708","volume":"53"},{"id":"fjeld2020","abstract":"The rapid spread of artificial intelligence (AI) systems has precipitated a rise in ethical and human rights-based frameworks intended to guide the development and use of these technologies.

Most project managers tend to spend less time in identifying risks and more time in risk mitigation, ignoring the fact that unidentified risks cannot be mitigated. However, it is worth noting that risk identification forms the bedrock in the development of a suitable risk management plan. Once, the risk is identified proper planning process can be instituted to address it. The identification and management of risks can be a daunting task that requires the support of all project stakeholders. Moreover, the project manager does not have monopoly of knowledge and as such requires significant inputs from other stakeholders especially in identifying project risks. This paper delves into the meaning of risk, its significance and how it can be efficiently managed by the project team. In addition, it covers the techniques used to gather risk information, essence of the project risk register and categorization, analysis, response and monitoring of project risk. Considering the fact that a project is a risky venture; there is absolute need for the project manager and team to plan for it. Risks are uncertainties, that may or may not occur; but if it occurs and there is no plan to address it, can mess up the work of the project manager and thus, resulting in project failure. The planning for risks is inevitable in project management and as such should not be treated with levity. The rationale for having an effective risk management plan are thus; prevent waste of project resources, prevent the project from failing, timely delivering of the project, ability to meet client’s requirements, serves as a source of learning for future projects.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,21]]},"author":[{"family":"George","given":"Crispin"}],"citation-key":"georgeEssenceRiskIdentification2020","container-title":"International Journal of Science and Research (IJSR)","container-title-short":"IJSR","DOI":"10.21275/SR20215023033","ISSN":"23197064","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020",2,5]]},"language":"en","page":"973–978","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The Essence of Risk Identification in Project Risk Management: An Overview","title-short":"The Essence of Risk Identification in Project Risk Management","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.ijsr.net/archive/v9i2/SR20215023033.pdf","volume":"9"},{"id":"gilbert2023","abstract":"Social media have become very popular as the number of users, organizations and research associated continue to increase rapidly. As such, user profiling becomes prominent as it enables the extraction of information and knowledge pertaining to users from their profiles. There is a growing number of current literatures related to social media and user profiling, but none that demonstrates both as a general entity or overview. Hence a distinctive representation of related attributes will enhance understanding and knowledge in this field. In this paper, bibliometric analysis was conducted to review social media profiling trends across Scopus-indexed publications from 2012 to 2022. The study analyzed distribution of keywords and VOS viewer software was used for data visualization. The findings and analysis lead to the development of a taxonomy to classify social media user profiling through several attributes—data source, trends, applications, techniques and current approaches.

It aids in proliferating information and data sources, improving software's data management capabilities, and designing intricate and advanced algorithms. AI is changing the way brands and users interact with one another. The application of this technology is highly dependent on the nature of the website and the type of business. Marketers can now focus more on the customer and meet their needs in real time. By using AI, they can quickly determine what content to target customers and which channel to employ at what moment, thanks to the data collected and generated by its algorithms. Users feel at ease and are more inclined to buy what is offered when AI is used to personalise their experiences. AI tools can also be used to analyse the performance of a competitor's campaigns and reveal their customers' expectations. Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows computers to analyse and interpret data without being explicitly programmed. Furthermore, ML assists humans in solving problems efficiently. The algorithm learns and improves performance and accuracy as more data is fed into the algorithm. For this research, relevant articles on AI in marketing are identified from Scopus, Google scholar, researchGate and other platforms. Then these articles were read, and the theme of the paper was developed. This paper attempts to review the role of AI in marketing. The specific applications of AI in various marketing segments and their transformations for marketing sectors are examined.

In relation to that, examining the factors that influence online trust and purchase intention has become essential. The prime purpose of this study was to examine whether perceived service quality, customer reviews, product assortment, and website quality significantly influence online purchase intention. It also aimed to verify if trust mediates the relationships among them. The data was gathered from several customers of online retailers in the UAE via an online survey. To confirm the proposed hypotheses and make inferences, all responses were analyzed based on structural equation modeling approach using PLS-SEM. It was shown that trust positively influences online purchase intention. The results also demonstrated that trust and online purchase intention are positively affected by perceived service quality, customer reviews, product assortment, and website quality. Finally, the results confirmed that trust has a mediating effect among the aforementioned factors and online purchase intention.

Given the likely impact of this model on data science, through this perspective article, we seek to provide an overview of the potential opportunities and challenges associated with using ChatGPT in data science, provide readers with a snapshot of its advantages, and stimulate interest in its use for data science projects. The paper discusses how ChatGPT can assist data scientists in automating various aspects of their workflow, including data cleaning and preprocessing, model training, and result interpretation. It also highlights how ChatGPT has the potential to provide new insights and improve decision-making processes by analyzing unstructured data. We then examine the advantages of ChatGPT’s architecture, including its ability to be fine-tuned for a wide range of language-related tasks and generate synthetic data. Limitations and issues are also addressed, particularly around concerns about bias and plagiarism when using ChatGPT. Overall, the paper concludes that the benefits outweigh the costs and ChatGPT has the potential to greatly enhance the productivity and accuracy of data science workflows and is likely to become an increasingly important tool for intelligence augmentation in the field of data science. ChatGPT can assist with a wide range of natural language processing tasks in data science, including language translation, sentiment analysis, and text classification. However, while ChatGPT can save time and resources compared to training a model from scratch, and can be fine-tuned for specific use cases, it may not perform well on certain tasks if it has not been specifically trained for them.

With the emergence of the public cloud's vast usage, administrators must be able to have a reliable method to provide the seamless experience that a public cloud offers on a smaller scale, such as a private cloud. When a smaller deployment or a private cloud is needed, OpenStack can meet the goals without increasing cost or sacrificing data control.To demonstrate these enablement goals of resiliency and elasticity in IaaS and PaaS, the authors design a private distributed system cloud platform using OpenStack and its core services of Nova, Swift, Cinder, Neutron, Keystone, Horizon and Glance on a five-node deployment.Through the demonstration of dynamically adding an IaaS node, pushing the deployment to its physical and logical limits, and eventually crashing the deployment, this paper shows how the PackStack utility facilitates the provisioning of an elastic and resilient OpenStack-based IaaS platform that can be used in production if the deployment is kept within designated boundaries.The authors adopt the multinode-capable PackStack utility in favor of an all-in-one OpenStack build for a true demonstration of resiliency, elasticity and scalability in a small-scale IaaS. An all-in-one deployment is generally used for proof-of-concept deployments and is not easily scaled in production across multiple nodes. The authors demonstrate that combining PackStack with the multi-node design is suitable for smaller-scale production IaaS and PaaS deployments.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",9,27]]},"author":[{"family":"Heuchert","given":"Samuel"},{"family":"Rimal","given":"Bhaskar Prasad"},{"family":"Reisslein","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Yong"}],"citation-key":"heuchert2025","container-title":"Applied Computing and Informatics","DOI":"10.1108/ACI-04-2021-0094","ISSN":"2210-8327","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",1,30]]},"page":"164–183","source":"Silverchair","title":"Design of a small-scale and failure-resistant IaaS cloud using OpenStack","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1108/ACI-04-2021-0094","volume":"21"},{"id":"high-levelexpertgrouponartificialintelligence2018","abstract":"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,22]]},"author":[{"literal":"High-Level Expert Group on Artificial Intelligence"}],"citation-key":"high-levelexpertgrouponartificialintelligence2018","genre":"Text","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",12,17]]},"language":"en","title":"Ethics Guidelines for Trustworthy AI","type":"report","URL":"https://ec.europa.eu/futurium/en/ai-alliance-consultation"},{"id":"hoepfl1997","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoepfl","given":"Marie C."}],"citation-key":"hoepfl1997","container-title":"Journal of Technology Education","container-title-short":"JTE","DOI":"10.21061/jte.v9i1.a.4","ISSN":"1045-1064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",9,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Choosing Qualitative Research: A Primer for Technology Education Researchers","title-short":"Choosing Qualitative Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v9n1/hoepfl.html","volume":"9"},{"id":"hoepfl1997a","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,17]]},"author":[{"family":"Hoepfl","given":"Marie C."}],"citation-key":"hoepfl1997a","container-title":"Journal of Technology Education","container-title-short":"JTE","DOI":"10.21061/jte.v9i1.a.4","ISSN":"1045-1064","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["1997",9,1]]},"language":"en","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Choosing Qualitative Research: A Primer for Technology Education Researchers","title-short":"Choosing Qualitative Research","type":"article-journal","URL":"http://scholar.lib.vt.edu/ejournals/JTE/v9n1/hoepfl.html","volume":"9"},{"id":"holmqvist2020","abstract":"Luxury brands have been reluctant to adopt technology-enhanced multi-actor interactions at the customer interface.

Although much scholarly attention has focused on modeling urban traffic congestion, news contents about traffic jam have rarely been examined systematically. This study selects 12 large metropolitan cities across Asia (Beijing, Bengaluru, Hong Kong, Jakarta, Kuala Lumpur, Manila, and Singapore), Oceania (Auckland and Sydney), Europe (London) and North America (Los Angeles and Toronto) for an in-depth content analysis. More than 40,000 pieces of congestion-related articles in the 2009–2018 period have been identified in the local news media of these cities. We apply techniques of text analytics to analyze underlying themes in relation to sustainable transport and congestion-mitigation measures. Also, a sentiment analysis is conducted to examine the level of frustration expressed. Results show that traffic congestion is no longer perceived to be primarily an economic issue. Concerns over the environmental impacts of traffic congestion were increasingly discussed. Based on the content analysis, cities in Asia mentioned a lot about congestion-related PM2.5 pollution and climate change was a recurrent theme among non-Asian cities. Economic cost related to traffic congestion has received much more attention in high-income cities. With regard to congestion mitigation measures, terms related to promoting public and active transport was the most popular, followed by restriction and regulation measures, and then intelligent transport system (ITS) or smart mobility adoption. It is noteworthy that road capacity expansion has attracted the lowest coverage. Generally, high-density cities discussed more about public and active transport in alleviating traffic jams; and police enforcement was seen as important in tackling traffic congestion across all cities. In relation to the sentiment, there is a positive association between the overall traffic congestion level and the congestion frustration level expressed in local news.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,4]]},"author":[{"family":"Huang","given":"Zhiran"},{"family":"Loo","given":"Becky P.

This study aims to enhance TPB by examining the moderating effect of consumer demography on the intention-purchase relationship. A survey of 450 internet shoppers was conducted, with data analyzed using Partial Least Square. Results indicate that online purchase intention, eWOM, and trust significantly impact online purchases, with eWOM and trust being fully mediated by online purchase intention. Demographic factors did not moderate the intention-purchase relationship but did influence the trust-purchase relationship. Trust also served as a moderator.

Also, we will go through the future benefits of cloud computing and the upcoming possible challenges we will have. Intext Cloud, performance, cloud computing, architecture, scale-up, and big data are all terms used in this context. Cloud computing offers a wide range of architectural configurations, including the number of processors, memory, and nodes. Cloud computing has already changed the way we store, process, and access data, and it is expected to continue to have a significant impact on the future of information technology. Cloud computing enables organizations to scale their IT resources up or down quickly and easily, without the need for costly hardware upgrades. This can help organizations to respond more quickly to changing business needs and market conditions. By moving IT resources to the cloud, organizations can reduce their IT infrastructure costs and improve their operational efficiency. Cloud computing also allows organizations to pay only for the resources they use, rather than investing in expensive hardware and software licenses. Cloud providers invest heavily in security and compliance measures, which can help to protect organizations from cyber threats and ensure regulatory compliance. Cloud computing provides a scalable platform for AI and machine learning applications, enabling organizations to build and deploy these technologies more easily and cost-effectively. A task, an application, and its input can take up to 20 times longer or cost 10 times more than optimal. Cloud products’ ready adaptability has resulted in a paradigm change. Previously, an application was optimized for a specific cluster; however, in the cloud, the architectural configuration is tuned for the workload. The evolution of cloud computing from the era of mainframes and dumb terminals has been significant, but there are still many advancements to come. As we look towards the future, IT leaders and the companies they serve will face increasingly complex challenges in order to stay competitive in a constantly evolving cloud computing landscape. Additionally, it will be crucial to remain compliant with existing regulations as well as new regulations that may emerge in the future. It is safe to say that the next decade of cloud computing will be just as dramatic as the last where many internet services are becoming cloud-based, and huge enterprises will struggle to fund physical infrastructure. Cloud computing is significantly used in business innovation and because of its agility and adaptability, cloud technology enables new ways of working, operating, and running a business. The service enables users to access files and applications stored in the cloud from anywhere, removing the requirement for users to be always physically close to actual hardware. Cloud computing makes the connection available from anywhere because they are kept on a network of hosted computers that carry data over the internet. Cloud computing has shown to be advantageous to both consumers and corporations. To be more specific, the cloud has altered our way of life. Overall, cloud computing is likely to continue to play a significant role in the future of IT, enabling organizations to become more agile, efficient, and innovative in the face of rapid technological change. This is likely to drive further innovation in AI and machine learning in the coming years.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Islam","given":"Rafia"},{"family":"Patamsetti","given":"Vardhan"},{"family":"Gadhi","given":"Aparna"},{"family":"Gondu","given":"Ragha Madhavi"},{"family":"Bandaru","given":"Chinna Manikanta"},{"family":"Kesani","given":"Sai Chaitanya"},{"family":"Abiona","given":"Olatunde"}],"citation-key":"islam2023","container-title":"International Journal of Communications, Network and System Sciences","DOI":"10.4236/ijcns.2023.164004","issue":"4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",4,17]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/","number":"4","page":"53–65","publisher":"Scientific Research Publishing","source":"www.scirp.org","title":"The Future of Cloud Computing: Benefits and Challenges","title-short":"The Future of Cloud Computing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.scirp.org/journal/paperinformation?paperid=124299","volume":"16"},{"id":"iso/iec420012023","abstract":"Information technology — Artificial intelligence — Management system","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,23]]},"author":[{"literal":"ISO/IEC 42001"}],"authority":"International Standards Organisation","citation-key":"iso/iec420012023","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","section":"ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 42","title":"ISO/IEC 42001:2023 Information Technology  - Artificial Inelligence - Management system","title-short":"ISO/IEC 42001","type":"standard","URL":"https://www.iso.org/standard/42001"},{"id":"iso/tc2102006","author":[{"literal":"ISO/TC 210"}],"authority":"ISO","citation-key":"iso/tc2102006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006"]]},"number":"62304","publisher":"ISO","section":"ISO/TC 210","title":"IEC 62304:2006 Medical devices software - Software life cycle processes","type":"standard"},{"id":"ISO270000_2018","abstract":"Information technology — Security techniques — Information security management systems — Overview and vocabulary","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,5]]},"authority":"ISO","citation-key":"ISO270000_2018","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018"]]},"language":"en","section":"ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 27","title":"ISO/IEC 27000:2018","title-short":"ISO/IEC 27000","type":"standard","URL":"https://www.iso.org/standard/73906.html"},{"id":"ISO27001","authority":"ISO","citation-key":"ISO27001","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022"]]},"number":"ISO27001:2022","publisher-place":"Switzerland","title":"Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection - Information security management systems - Requirements","type":"standard"},{"id":"ITopOpenSource","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,29]]},"citation-key":"ITopOpenSource","title":"iTop: open source ITIL ITSM CMDB Software","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.combodo.com/itop-193"},{"id":"iveson2024","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Iveson","given":"Helena"}],"citation-key":"iveson2024","container-title":"Royal Surrey NHS Foundation Trust","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",6,19]]},"language":"en","title":"Radiotherapy service update | News","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.royalsurrey.nhs.uk/news/radiotherapy-service-update-12715"},{"id":"jadil2022","abstract":"In recent years, examining the determinants and outcomes of online trust in emerging online markets in the North Africa Region has been lacking.

Our results empirically confirm a common concern: AI practitioners’ value priorities differ from those of the general public. Compared to the US-representative sample, AI practitioners appear to consider responsible AI values as less important and emphasize a different set of values. In contrast, self-identified women and black respondents found responsible AI values more important than other groups.

Scholars have argued the importance of research focusing on transportation planning that aims to mitigate traffic congestion and reduce economic costs.

With this perspective, this study seeks to explore the interrelationship between congestion, income, and employment. To this end, we focus on 86 US metropolitan areas by utilizing a simultaneous equation model. The results show that there is an interrelationship between income growth, employment growth, and congestion growth, but their effects are somewhat different between periods of the economic boom in the 1990s and the economic recession in the 2000s. In addition, our findings clearly show that traffic congestion growth negatively affects income growth and employment growth.

Very little evidence in academic literature is present regarding the factors affecting the usage of GAI in Digital Marketing (DM). This study addresses this gap by exploring the key drivers and barriers associated with using GAI in DM. Leveraging Behavioral Reasoning Theory (BRT), the research validates prior findings and introduces a conceptual model outlining factors that shape attitudes toward adopting GAI in DM to enhance customer experiences. A qualitative inductive approach was undertaken by conducting expert interviews to investigate the “reasons for” and ‘reasons against’ using GAI in DM and its impact on customer experience. The transcripts generated were manually coded and a deductive thematic analysis was done using the BRT as the theoretical framework. The findings indicate four significant themes for adopting GAI in digital marketing viz: innovation, creative communication and content creation, speed, efficiency and timesaving, enhanced customization and personalization; predictive analytics and simulation. It also indicates five significant themes related to the key barriers were also identified viz: ethics and infringement of Intellectual Property; security and deepfake; learning ecosystem for the adoption of new technology; quality of data; reduced manpower requirement. The study further highlights how GAI influences customer experience in DM. This study contributes to the field by (a) proposing a conceptual framework for applying GAI in DM to improve customer experiences, (b) examining the drivers and challenges of GAI adoption in DM, and (c) presenting a research agenda to guide future studies.

Finally, the experimental results indicate that the Apache Spark is faster in execution times by 3.5× than Hadoop, and the Apache Flink achieves 40% lower latency on real time analytics than Spark. Google Bigtable had good throughput at 5 million queries a second, but it was not flexible to computationally intense processes. Furthermore, this study examined the application of the machine learning and blockchain technologies in the implementation of the distributed systems for the unified backend that incorporates processing efficiency improvement by 25% and data integrity with the added computational overhead of 12%. The research demonstrates that Flink is most suitable for real time data streams, spark is the best tool for iterative workloads and bigtable is the most appropriate for structured high throughput storage. Nevertheless, questions remain on how to scale in the extreme workload case and balance security with performance.

The respective reward function is constructed using features extracted through a feature selection, and their corresponding weights are obtained by two optimization models, which are applicable for ranking results represented to the new users. In addition, new performance criteria were developed to illustrate the performance of the presented ranking method. To evaluate and test the proposed ranking algorithm, a real medium-sized dataset from a search engine is preprocessed and used in this research. Findings show promising results and decisive superiority over the default ranking method.

As the urban population continues to grow, a greater number of people risk exposure to traffic-related air pollution (TRAP) and its adverse, costly health effects. In many cities, there is a need and scope for air quality improvements through targeted policy interventions, which continue to grow including rapidly changing technologies.\nObjective\nThis systematic evidence map (SEM) examines and characterizes peer-reviewed evidence on urban-level policy interventions aimed at reducing traffic emissions and/or TRAP from on-road mobile sources, thus potentially reducing human exposures and adverse health effects and producing various co-benefits.\nMethods\nThis SEM follows a previously peer-reviewed and published protocol with minor deviations, explicitly outlined here. Articles indexed in Public Affairs Index, TRID, Medline and Embase were searched, limited to English, published between January 1, 2000, and June 1, 2020. Covidence was used to screen articles based on previously developed eligibility criteria. Data for included articles was extracted and manually documented into an Excel database. Data visualizations were created in Tableau.\nResults\nWe identified 7528 unique articles from database searches and included 376 unique articles in the final SEM. There were 58 unique policy interventions, and a total of 1,139 unique policy scenarios, comprising these interventions and different combinations thereof. The policy interventions fell under 6 overarching policy categories: 1) pricing, 2) land use, 3) infrastructure, 4) behavioral, 5) technology, and 6) management, standards, and services, with the latter being the most studied. For geographic location, 463 policy scenarios were studied in Europe, followed by 355 in Asia, 206 in North America, 57 in South America, 10 in Africa, and 7 in Australia. Alternative fuel technology was the most frequently studied intervention (271 times), followed by vehicle emission regulation (134 times). The least frequently studied interventions were vehicle ownership taxes, and studded tire regulations, studied once each. A mere 3 % of studies addressed all elements of the full-chain—traffic emissions, TRAP, exposures, and health. The evidence recorded for each unique policy scenario is hosted in an open-access, query-able Excel database, and a complementary interactive visualization tool. We showcase how users can find more about the effectiveness of the 1,139 included policy scenarios in reducing, increasing, having mixed or no effect on traffic emissions and/or TRAP.\nConclusion\nThis is the first peer-reviewed SEM to compile international evidence on urban-level policy interventions to reduce traffic emissions and/or TRAP in the context of human exposure and health effects. We also documented reported enablers, barriers, and co-benefits. The open-access Excel database and interactive visualization tool can be valuable resources for practitioners, policymakers, and researchers.

Using a between-subjects experimental design, the research explores how human influencers (HIs), human-like virtual influencers (HVIs), and anime-like virtual influencers (AVIs) affect perceptions of authenticity, source credibility, and overall marketing effectiveness. The study evaluates these influencer types across both for-profit and not-for-profit messaging contexts to determine how message intent influences audience reactions. The findings reveal that HVIs can be as effective as human influencers, especially in not-for-profit messaging, where their authenticity and source credibility are higher. However, when the messaging shifts to for-profit motives, the advantage of HVIs diminishes, aligning more closely with AVIs, which consistently show lower effectiveness. The study highlights the critical role that both authenticity and source credibility play in mediating the relationship between the type of influencer and advertising effectiveness.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Kim","given":"Donggyu"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Zituo"}],"citation-key":"kim2024a","container-title":"Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans","container-title-short":"Computers in Human Behavior: Artificial Humans","DOI":"10.1016/j.chbah.2024.100100","ISSN":"29498821","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",8]]},"language":"en","page":"100100","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Social media influencer vs. virtual influencer: The mediating role of source credibility and authenticity in advertising effectiveness within AI influencer marketing","title-short":"Social media influencer vs. virtual influencer","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2949882124000604","volume":"2"},{"id":"kleinman2024","abstract":"Friday's IT outage is a poignant reminder of how reliant the world has become on devices managed remotely by huge firms.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",8,24]]},"author":[{"family":"Kleinman","given":"Zoew"}],"citation-key":"kleinman2024","container-title":"BBC News","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",7,19]]},"language":"en-GB","section":"Technology","title":"How a single IT update caused global havoc","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwdyxx0v64o"},{"id":"knimeag2024","author":[{"literal":"KNIME AG"}],"citation-key":"knimeag2024","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"license":"GNU General Public License","title":"KNIME Analytics Platform","type":"webpage","URL":"https://www.knime.com/"},{"id":"ko2016","abstract":"This special issue on luxury brand strategies and customer experiences includes eleven research papers which are valuable for marketers and researchers.

This paper introduces an innovative solution employing psychological intention diagrams to enhance search accuracy. These diagrams harness historical data to depict the search intentions associated with specific keywords, reflecting both user and web designer perspectives. By integrating these diagrams, our proposed search engine significantly refines its ability to predict and retrieve the most relevant images. The implementation of this system involves constructing two types of intention diagrams: one based on past user queries and another derived from the intentions of web designers for cases without historical user data. This dual approach not only captures the semantic essence of images more effectively but also addresses the multi-faceted meanings of search keywords. Our experimental results confirm that incorporating psychological dimensions into image search mechanisms substantially improves precision, facilitating more accurate and user-aligned image retrieval. This pioneering approach is the first to apply psychological profiling in enhancing image search engine functionalities, marking a significant advancement in digital image retrieval technologies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,22]]},"author":[{"family":"KP","given":"Aswathi"},{"family":"Yadwad","given":"Sunita"},{"family":"Nirmal Raj","given":"D."},{"family":"Rastogi","given":"Shailesh"}],"citation-key":"kp2025","container-title":"2025 3rd International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS)","DOI":"10.1109/ICICACS65178.2025.10967745","event-title":"2025 3rd International Conference on Integrated Circuits and Communication Systems (ICICACS)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",2]]},"page":"1–7","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Enhancing Image Search Engine Accuracy Using Psychological Intention Diagrams","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10967745"},{"id":"kroll2018","abstract":"This article summarizes best practices by organizations to manage their data, which should encompass the full range of responsibilities borne by the use of data in automated decision making, including data security, privacy, avoidance of undue discrimination, accountability, and transparency.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Kroll","given":"Joshua A."}],"citation-key":"kroll2018","container-title":"IEEE Security & Privacy","DOI":"10.1109/MSEC.2018.2875329","ISSN":"1558-4046","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",11]]},"page":"61–70","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Data Science Data Governance [AI Ethics]","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8636447","volume":"16"},{"id":"kruger1999","abstract":"People tend to hold overly favorable views of their abilities in many social and intellectual domains.

With internet services in the hands of almost all, buying through e-commerce platforms has become easy. Gone are the days when consumers were diffident in buying online as they had issues of quality, quantity, trust, payment, delivery mode, price etc. Marketers came up with a number of strategies to encourage online buying.The last decade has seen a rise in customers buying all types of product categories be it FMCG, food, books, apparel, consumer durables, furniture, medicines and even jewellery. Buying jewellery in India is mostly a family affair and is an emotional process. Be it jewellery for investment, gifting, occasions like birth of child, marriage, religious functions, festivals, each piece of jewellery bought has emotions attached. Most Indians had their fixed favourite family jewellers from whom the purchase was done. With advent of ecommerce, major jeweller brands started selling through online mode. They rolled out different strategies to attract customers to buy jewellery online. They left no stone unturned to motivate the online buyers. A paradigm shift was observed as customers moved from offline to online for purchase of different kinds of jewellery.This paper focuses on understanding marketing strategies adopted by major jewellers and the varied buying behaviour of Indian consumers for online purchase of jewellery. The researchers aim to understand how a high involvement product like jewellery could be showcased to its customers and customers lured to purchase from a virtual store rather than the traditional brick and mortar store. The researchers collected secondary data from several research papers to understand consumer’s preferences for jewellery both offline and online. Media Reports, Press Releases, Reserve Bank of India, Gem & Jewellery Export Promotion Council ‘s reports have been studied to understand the strategies of jewellers as well as customers’ acceptance level of the marketing strategies..

Definitions of gamification tend to vary by person, both in industry and within academia. One particularly popular lay interpretation, introduced and popularized by Ian Bogost, and reiterated by Jan Klabbers, is that gamification is “bullshit” and “exploitationware.” They describe gamification as a marketing term or business practice invented to sell products rather than to represent a real and unique phenomenon relevant to a nascent game science. However, this view is an oversimplification, one which ignores a growing body of theory development and empirical research on gamification within a post-positivist epistemology. In fact, because gamification is so much more outcome-focused than general game design, current gamification research in many ways has a stronger footing in modern social science than much games research does.\nAim. In this article, to address common misunderstandings like these, we describe the philosophical underpinnings of modern gamification research, define the relationship between games and gamification, define and situate gamification science as a subdiscipline of game science, and explicate a six-element framework of major concerns within gamification science: predictor constructs, criterion constructs, mediator constructs, moderator constructs, design processes, and research methods. This framework is also presented diagrammatically as a causal path model.\nConclusion. Gamification science refers to the development of theories of gamification design and their empirical evaluation within a post-positivist epistemology. The goal of gamification scientist-practitioners should be to understand how to best meet organizational goals through the design of gamification interventions, drawing upon insights derived from both gamification science and games research more broadly.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Landers","given":"Richard N."},{"family":"Auer","given":"Elena M."},{"family":"Collmus","given":"Andrew B."},{"family":"Armstrong","given":"Michael B."}],"citation-key":"landers2018","container-title":"Simulation & Gaming","DOI":"10.1177/1046878118774385","ISSN":"1046-8781","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",6,1]]},"language":"EN","page":"315–337","publisher":"SAGE Publications Inc","source":"SAGE Journals","title":"Gamification Science, Its History and Future: Definitions and a Research Agenda","title-short":"Gamification Science, Its History and Future","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1177/1046878118774385","volume":"49"},{"id":"larson2025","abstract":"Social media has transformed how we communicate, connect, and consume information in the modern digital age.

A 14-day campaign was conducted on the Meta Ads platform, evaluating three content types—single image, carousel, and video—under identical ad set budgets. Performance was measured using key metrics including impressions, Cost Per Mille (CPM), clicks (CPC), post engagements, cost per engagement, and engagement rate. The findings reveal that video content substantially outperformed the other formats, achieving the highest engagement rate of 4.21% at the lowest cost per post engagement IDR 142.

But following a major reform of local government in 2000, innovatively designed new paths were opened up for administrations to address these issues throughout the UK and especially in the capital. This fresh collection of powers allowed policy pioneers who were sufficiently brave and skilled to try to turn old radical ideas like Road Pricing and pro-actively promoting extensive bus use into ‘new’ implemented schemes. And, without doubt, Ken Livingstone's Congestion Charge is seen by many transport policy experts as the ace in the capital's pack of new measures to tackle age-old traffic problems. However, notwithstanding the extent of political enthusiasm for the recent radical developments, especially from Blair's New Labour administration that paved the way for such moves, as far as the public are concerned, the jury is still out considering the question of whether current policy direction is leading to tangible improvement for the majority of Londoners and its visitors. This paper examines how well the claims for progress by protagonists of recent developments are substantiated by recent research and the latest pertinent data. It also shows that although the prime causes of key problems like traffic jams can seem to be a simple consequence of too many cars on a finite road space, the true cause of such problems is a far more complex array of factors – including the form and impact of traffic management policy itself. Correspondingly, when the available data is examined with fresh rigour it reveals that the case for the current form and thrust of contemporary UK transport policy is far from proved by events in London.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,8]]},"author":[{"family":"Mannings","given":"Leon"}],"citation-key":"mannings2006","container-title":"Local Government Studies","DOI":"10.1080/03003930600693187","ISSN":"0300-3930","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",6,1]]},"page":"273–292","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"Traffic and roads since 2000: Policy, politics and perceptions of progress","title-short":"Traffic and roads since 2000","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/03003930600693187","volume":"32"},{"id":"manoharan2024","abstract":"A description of the abstract for the research paper titled “Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management in E-commerce Using Machine Learning Algorithms” is as follows: In this research, a novel strategy for implementing force operations in e-commerce is presented. This strategy involves the utilization of predictive analytics and machine literacy algorithms. When it comes to the ever-changing landscape of online retail, efficient force operation is necessary to satisfy customer demand while simultaneously minimizing the costs that are connected with overstocking and stockouts. To predict future demand for specific products, prophetic analytics methods are utilized, which involve the utilization of literal deal data in addition to other relevant elements. To create accurate prophetic models that are capable of locating complicated patterns and trends in the data, machine literacy methods such as arbitrary timbers, support vector machines, and neural networks are utilized. Through the incorporation of these prophetic models into the process of force operation, ecommerce businesses canoptimize force circumstances, expedite operations, and improve customer happiness. In addition to making a contribution to the expanding body of literature on data-driven approaches to force operation, this investigation demonstrates the potential for predictive analytics and machine literacy to be utilized in the process of tackling the specific issues that are associated with ecommerce.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Manoharan","given":"Geetha"},{"family":"Sharma","given":"Anupama"},{"family":"Vani","given":"V Divya"},{"family":"Raj","given":"Vijilius Helena"},{"family":"Jain","given":"Rishabh"},{"family":"Nijhawan","given":"Ginni"}],"citation-key":"manoharan2024","container-title":"2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics (ACCAI)","DOI":"10.1109/ACCAI61061.2024.10602148","event-title":"2024 International Conference on Advances in Computing, Communication and Applied Informatics (ACCAI)","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",5]]},"page":"1–5","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Predictive Analytics for Inventory Management in E-commerce Using Machine Learning Algorithms","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10602148"},{"id":"marroncelli2022","abstract":"The British high street is in a state of demise. Data analysis from The Guardian has revealed that almost every town centre in England and Wales has declined since 2013, with some towns losing over a fifth of their stores. Factors influencing this demise range from Brexit uncertainty, increased rents and business rates, rising operating costs and an increase in online shopping. The aim of this paper is to explore the cult of celebrity, its deployment within social media, and how this has been central to the rise of online retailing, and ultimately, the decline of the British high street. Celebrity culture and the British high street have both been affected by the meteoric rise of the digital age, which has created a shifting retail landscape. The digital age affects how celebrities are discovered, and how they promote themselves to remain relevant. A new celebrity has been born as ordinary individuals find fame by appearing on reality television. These celebrities remain in the public eye, becoming “influencers,” and promoting fashion brands through their social media. There is a lack of academic research on the credibility of celebrities within social networks. Instagram influencers have affected clothing on the physical high street, by encouraging consumers to shop online. “Fast fashion” can be described as “low-cost clothing collections that mimic current luxury fashion trends.” This type of clothing “helps state deeply held desires among young consumers.” Young consumers follow reality celebrities on social media, and this impacts their purchasing choices. Drawing from an archive at Nottingham Trent University, this paper explores connections between fast fashion, celebrity and social media, and addresses the shifting retail landscape. Social media platforms like Instagram encourage consumers to buy clothing at the click of a button. This raises debates surrounding the implications of instant gratification on the fashion retail landscape.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Marroncelli","given":"Rose"},{"family":"Braithwaite","given":"Naomi"}],"citation-key":"marroncelli2022","container-title":"Fashion Practice","DOI":"10.1080/17569370.2020.1794321","ISSN":"1756-9370","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",1,2]]},"page":"124–150","publisher":"Routledge","source":"Taylor and Francis+NEJM","title":"#insta-fashion: How the Digital Revolution Has Affected Celebrity Culture and the British Fashion Retail Landscape","title-short":"#insta-fashion","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1080/17569370.2020.1794321","volume":"14"},{"id":"martini2024","abstract":"The aim of this position paper is to identify a specific focus and the major challenges related to the human-centered artificial intelligence (HCAI) approach in the field of Industry 5.0 and the circular economy. A first step towards the opening of a line of research is necessary to aggregate multidisciplinary and interdisciplinary skills to promote and take into consideration the different aspects related to this topic, from the more technical and engineering aspects to the social ones and the repercussions in terms of sustainability. The proposal and vision of this preliminary work is to identify and discuss a suitable field for such interaction. This field has been identified, specifically, within additive manufacturing (AM) in the context of Industry 5.0. Additive manufacturing (AM), is a disruptive opportunity for more sustainable production systems that can be better optimized with AI, becoming an ideal platform for interconnection between different levels of application and integration of HCAI concepts, and at the same time able to prove them. In this context, two prospective areas with a high application impact of HCAI are those of AM-oriented supply chain and product customization in the AM field, enabled by a plethora of recently emerging technologies such as the internet of things, cloud and edge computing, and next-generation networks (5G). The paper concludes with the challenges HCAI poses to public policymakers, who face significant policy challenges in regulating artificial intelligence, and addressing the socioeconomic and technological impacts.

The ability of a company to plan, implement, and manage digital marketing to increase its competitiveness in the eyes of consumers is referred to as digital marketing capability. This research presents a digital marketing utilization index (DMUI) to evaluate and improve a company’s digital marketing capability. DMUI is made up of three components: the innovation ecosystem readiness, the adoption of digital marketing technology, and the company’s digital transformation. Based on data from 217 companies in Indonesia, the results show that the DMUI of companies in Indonesia has an average of 71.97, indicating that the level of digital marketing capabilities of companies in Indonesia is in the medium category. They can improve their digital marketing capabilities by increasing the role of managerial innovativeness, organizational readiness, and perceived usefulness. Furthermore, businesses must carry out digital transformation by governing the transformation and reinvention of new business models. Finally, in addition to implementing digital marketing via websites, social media, mobile marketing, and content marketing, they must emphasize the importance of digital analytics, digital CRM, digital advertising, and display advertising to improve their company’s digital marketing capabilities.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Masrianto","given":"Agus"},{"family":"Hartoyo","given":"Hartoyo"},{"family":"Hubeis","given":"Aida Vitayala S."},{"family":"Hasanah","given":"Nur"}],"citation-key":"masrianto2022","container-title":"Journal of Open Innovation: Technology, Market, and Complexity","DOI":"10.3390/joitmc8030153","ISSN":"2199-8531","issue":"3","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",9]]},"language":"en","license":"http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/","page":"153","publisher":"Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute","source":"www.mdpi.com","title":"Digital Marketing Utilization Index for Evaluating and Improving Company Digital Marketing Capability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.mdpi.com/2199-8531/8/3/153","volume":"8"},{"id":"mccartney2006","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,3]]},"author":[{"family":"McCartney","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"mccartney2006","issued":{"date-parts":[["2006",9,18]]},"license":"GPL-3.0","title":"SuperCollider Screenshot","type":"graphic","URL":"commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid+62694653"},{"id":"mccartneySuperCollider2023","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,13]]},"author":[{"family":"McCartney","given":"James"}],"citation-key":"mccartneySuperCollider2023","genre":"C++","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",2,19]]},"license":"GPL-3.0","title":"SuperCollider","type":"software","URL":"supercollider.github.io","version":"3.1.0"},{"id":"medicines&healthcareproductsregulatoryagency","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,25]]},"author":[{"literal":"Medicines & Healthcare products Regulatory Agency"}],"citation-key":"medicines&healthcareproductsregulatoryagency","title":"Yellow Card | Making medicines and medical devices safer","type":"webpage","URL":"https://yellowcard.mhra.gov.uk/"},{"id":"microsoft2025","abstract":"Invent with purpose, realize cost savings, and make your organisation more efficient with Microsoft Azure’s open and flexible cloud computing platform.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,4]]},"author":[{"literal":"Microsoft"}],"citation-key":"microsoft2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en-GB","title":"Cloud Computing Services | Microsoft Azure","type":"webpage","URL":"https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb"},{"id":"miessler2018","abstract":"Most everyone who thinks about how to solve problems in a formal way has run across the concepts of deductive and inductive reasoning.

It is difficult to grasp AI’s influence, because AI represents a general-purpose technology, which can be applied in different settings. One product in which AI plays a pivotal role is social media. In this context, for instance, AI is used to provide people with personalized newsfeeds to prolong time spent online, which might result in addictive-like behavior. Many factors such as sociodemographic variables, history of psychopathology and personality traits have been revealed as risk factors for developing problematic social media use patterns. Yet, to our knowledge attitudes toward AI have not been examined in association with problematic social media use. In a sample of n = 956 social media users, we observed that positive AI attitudes were linked to overuse of social media as assessed with an addiction framework. The effect size of this association was stronger for males than females. Further we observed that this association was mediated by time spent on social media. The present study shows that positive AI attitudes – although well-known to be positive regarding embracing new technologies – might come with risks for developing addictive patterns of technology use, such as social media.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Montag","given":"Christian"},{"family":"Elhai","given":"Jon D."}],"citation-key":"montag2025","container-title":"Addictive Behaviors Reports","container-title-short":"Addictive Behaviors Reports","DOI":"10.1016/j.abrep.2025.100613","ISSN":"23528532","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",12]]},"language":"en","page":"100613","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"The darker side of positive AI attitudes: Investigating associations with (problematic) social media use","title-short":"The darker side of positive AI attitudes","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S2352853225000318","volume":"22"},{"id":"moraINTEGRATIVEAGILEITSM2022","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",11,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mora","given":"Manuel"},{"family":"Marx Gomez","given":"Jorge"},{"family":"Reyes-Delgado","given":"Paola Yuritzy"},{"family":"Adelakun","given":"Olayele"}],"citation-key":"moraINTEGRATIVEAGILEITSM2022","container-title":"Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce","container-title-short":"Journal of Organizational Computing and Electronic Commerce","DOI":"10.1080/10919392.2022.2068905","ISSN":"1091-9392, 1532-7744","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"99–129","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"AN INTEGRATIVE AGILE ITSM FRAMEWORK OF TENETS AND PRACTICES – ITS DESIGN AND EXPLORATORY UTILIZATION","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/10919392.2022.2068905","volume":"32"},{"id":"mou2024","abstract":"In an increasingly digitized and data-saturated marketplace, the integration of multi-channel marketing strategies has become essential for organizations aiming to enhance customer engagement, streamline user experiences, and improve return on investment (ROI). This systematic review examines the evolution and effectiveness of integrated digital marketing approaches by synthesizing findings from 85 peer-reviewed studies published between 2005 and 2022. It investigates how the convergence of strategic channel coordination, artificial intelligence (AI)-driven personalization, CRM and CDP infrastructure, behavioral retargeting mechanisms, and ethical data governance collectively influence digital marketing performance across industries and platforms. The review reveals that channel orchestration—defined as the coordinated deployment of marketing messages across platforms such as email, mobile applications, websites, social media, and offline touchpoints—consistently leads to improved digital conversion rates, increased average order values, and reduced decision-making friction. Unlike fragmented campaigns, integrated multi-channel strategies foster a unified brand experience and allow consumers to navigate seamlessly between touchpoints, thereby amplifying message reinforcement and brand recall. A key focus of the study is the role of AI in transforming personalization from a rule-based, reactive function to a predictive and adaptive capability. Machine learning algorithms now enable dynamic content delivery, real-time segmentation, and behavioral prediction, enhancing user engagement and accelerating purchase decisions. The review highlights that organizations employing AI-powered personalization—particularly through product recommendations, adaptive messaging, and retargeting algorithms—demonstrate significant gains in ROI, customer lifetime value, and campaign efficiency. Central to the success of these efforts is the implementation of CRM and customer data platform (CDP) architectures, which serve as the operational backbone for managing real-time data integration and hyper-personalized campaign execution. These infrastructures facilitate the orchestration of customer insights across departments and ensure that every interaction is contextually relevant, timely, and behaviorally informed. The integration of CRM/CDP systems with marketing automation platforms further enables scalable, responsive, and intelligent engagement flows. The synthesis identifies a trend toward trust-based marketing design—marked by the implementation of opt-in frameworks, transparent data usage policies, and explainable AI—that aims to balance personalization goals with consumer autonomy and regulatory compliance.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,5]]},"author":[{"family":"Mou","given":"Anika Jahan"}],"citation-key":"mou2024","container-title":"Review of Applied Science and Technology","DOI":"10.63125/5w76qb87","issue":"04","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",12,5]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright (c) 2024 Review of Applied Science and Technology","page":"01–28","source":"rast-journal.org","title":"Marketing capstone insights: Leveraging multi-channel strategies for maximum digital conversion and ROI.","title-short":"MARKETING CAPSTONE INSIGHTS","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://rast-journal.org/index.php/RAST/article/view/9","volume":"3"},{"id":"mu2020","abstract":"Many luxury firms have successfully adopted online sales and online sales growth has outperformed offline sales growth.

To fill this research gap, the present study examines how different content types are perceived and how they influence brand responses through persuasion knowledge. A serial mediation model is developed, which posits that different content types lead to a varying conceptual persuasion knowledge, which then influences the activation of attitudinal persuasion knowledge and in turn results in different brand attitudes. The corresponding model is tested in an experimental study, using different content types in the context of the video game industry. The findings indicate that, through the proposed serial mediation, sponsored content leads to a more negative brand attitude than user-generated content and content marketing.

In today’s world, organizations recognize the vital role of data in modern business intelligence systems for making meaningful decisions and staying competitive in the field. Efficient and optimal data analytics provides a competitive edge to its performance and services. Major organizations generate, collect and process vast amounts of data, falling under the category of big data. Managing and analyzing the sheer volume and variety of big data is a cumbersome process. At the same time, proper utilization of the vast collection of an organization’s information can generate meaningful insights into business tactics. In this regard, two of the popular data management systems in the area of big data analytics (i.e., data warehouse and data lake) act as platforms to accumulate the big data generated and used by organizations. Although seemingly similar, both of them differ in terms of their characteristics and applications. This article presents a detailed overview of the roles of data warehouses and data lakes in modern enterprise data management.

It has been hypothesized that while congested traffic conditions may increase the number of vehicle crashes and interactions, their severity is normally lower than crashes under uncongested free flowing conditions. This is primarily due to the slower speeds of vehicles when congestion is present. Our analysis uses negative binomial count models to examine whether factors affecting casualties (fatalities, serious injuries and slight injuries) differed during congested time periods as opposed to uncongested time periods. We also controlled for congestion spatially using a number of proxy variables and estimated pedestrian casualty models since a large proportion of London casualties are pedestrians. Results are not conclusive. Our results suggest that road infrastructure effects may interact with congestion levels such that in London any spatial differences are largely mitigated. Some small differences are seen between the models for congested versus uncongested time periods, but no conclusive trends can be found. Our results lead us to suspect that congestion as a mitigator of crash severity is less likely to occur in urban conditions, but may still be a factor on higher speed roads and motorways.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Noland","given":"Robert B."},{"family":"Quddus","given":"Mohammed A."}],"citation-key":"noland2005","container-title":"Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","container-title-short":"Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","DOI":"10.1016/j.tra.2005.02.022","ISSN":"0965-8564","issue":"7","issued":{"date-parts":[["2005",8,1]]},"page":"737–754","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Congestion and safety: A spatial analysis of London","title-short":"Congestion and safety","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856405000467","volume":"39"},{"id":"noris2023","abstract":"Fashion companies have been using different forms of entertainment such as film and television, sport, music, museums, and photography as inspiration sources and as communication and marketing channels for decades.

While gaming offers a potential revenue stream from sales of physical and digital clothing, change in it is also the gateway to access new opportunities of the so-called metaverse. Moreover, the development of mixed realities might, in a sense, “democratize” the industry by offering at a lower price the digital version of products that attract customers. Through an analysis of secondary data and the study of three cases, this research aims to understand how fashion companies adopt and adapt digital games to develop their communication and marketing strategies, and how gaming companies exploit fashion to develop their products. The main goal is to analyze from an academic perspective how the gaming industry represents a communication and marketing channel in which creative companies can produce immersive experiences different from those available through other means. Finally, this article provides a map of the relationships between fashion and gaming by proposing three categories: gamification in fashion, fashion games and fashion in games.","author":[{"family":"Noris","given":"Alice"},{"family":"Sabatini","given":"Nadzeya"},{"family":"Cantoni","given":"Lorenzo"}],"citation-key":"noris2023","container-title":"Human-Computer Interaction","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-031-35602-5_34","editor":[{"family":"Kurosu","given":"Masaaki"},{"family":"Hashizume","given":"Ayako"}],"ISBN":"978-3-031-35602-5","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023"]]},"language":"en","page":"477–491","publisher":"Springer Nature Switzerland","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"Springer Link","title":"Fashion Games, Fashion in Games and Gamification in Fashion.

The history of costume jewellery goes back to ancient Egyptians, who were the first to produce glass, the major component of para ti products. The term ‘costume jewellery’ was though only first used one hundred years ago and there are now many variants of products within its orbit. The research indicates that Swiss costume jewellery consumers are both price sensitive and quality oriented, with women buying mainly for themselves rather than receiving it as a gift, looking for products that they can wear every day and usually purchasing from boutiques or specialist retailers who care about the jewellery’s story. Surveys and interviews were conducted with a sample of Swiss adults and a supplier was interviewed to help better understand the supply chain. Among other observations, primary research found that most of the survey respondents buy one piece of costume jewellery from time to time, with bracelets and rings the most popular. Respondents were willing to pay Swiss Francs CHF50-200 (€45-190; £40-160; $50-205) for handmade costume jewellery. Interviews showed that there is a clear trend towards fine jewellery and new collections, with different styles preferred in summer and winter. The recommendations from the research were that para ti should elaborate its brand identity and emphasize aspects of the brand’s story through media such as Facebook and Instagram. Since para ti imports jewellery from Ibiza, the brand should also take advantage of the ongoing hype around the island. Moreover, para ti should clearly position itself as an exclusive costume jewellery brand that offers handcrafted pieces of exceptional design and quality at a reasonable price. The brand should also broaden its focus from millennials to older groups. Strategically, para ti could seek to partner with a boutique such as Kowä, relaunch its online store, consider opening its own store in Zurich, offer seasonal and men’s collections, explore an expanded supplier base and extend its range to include precious metals.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,29]]},"author":[{"family":"O'Leary","given":"S."},{"family":"Hirt","given":"S."}],"citation-key":"oleary2015","genre":"Working paper","ISSN":"2755-3884","issued":{"date-parts":[["2015"]]},"language":"en","publisher":"Regent's University","publisher-place":"London","source":"repository.canterbury.ac.uk","title":"Profiling a niche market and establishing an entrepreneurial strategy for a niche brand; the costume jewellery sector in Switzerland","type":"report","URL":"https://www.regents.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-03/RWP2001%20O%27Leary%20S%20Hirt.pdf"},{"id":"oliveira2020","abstract":"Modal editing is a, nowadays rare, concept that offers multiple interaction modes which are optimized for specific types of actions and interactions within a text editor.

Clustering is crucial to performance with modern disk technology, since retrievals with filter factors down to 0.0005 are now performed most efficiently by sequential table search rather than by indexed access. DB2’s Multi-Dimensional Clustering (MDC) provides methods to \"dice\" the fact table along a number of orthogonal \"dimensions\", but only when these dimensions are columns in the fact table. The diced cells cluster fact rows on several of these \"dimensions\" at once so queries restricting several such columns can access crucially localized data, with much faster query response. Unfortunately, columns of dimension tables of a star schema are not usually represented in the fact table. In this paper, we show a simple way to adjoin physical copies of dimension columns to the fact table, dicing data to effectively cluster query retrieval, and explain how such dicing can be achieved on database products other than DB2. We provide benchmark measurements to show successful use of this methodology on three commercial database products.","author":[{"family":"O’Neil","given":"Patrick"},{"family":"O’Neil","given":"Elizabeth"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Xuedong"},{"family":"Revilak","given":"Stephen"}],"citation-key":"oneil2009","container-title":"Performance Evaluation and Benchmarking","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-642-10424-4_17","editor":[{"family":"Nambiar","given":"Raghunath"},{"family":"Poess","given":"Meikel"}],"ISBN":"978-3-642-10424-4","issued":{"date-parts":[["2009"]]},"language":"en","page":"237–252","publisher":"Springer","publisher-place":"Berlin, Heidelberg","source":"Springer Link","title":"The Star Schema Benchmark and Augmented Fact Table Indexing","type":"paper-conference"},{"id":"openstack2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,18]]},"author":[{"literal":"Openstack"}],"citation-key":"openstack2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,7]]},"title":"Overview — Installation Guide documentation","type":"webpage","URL":"https://docs.openstack.org/install-guide/overview.html#figure-hwreqs"},{"id":"oracle2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,18]]},"author":[{"literal":"Oracle"}],"citation-key":"oracle2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"title":"Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Documentation","type":"webpage","URL":"https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/Content/home.htm"},{"id":"ordnancesurveylimited2025","abstract":"OS Maps API offers the most convenient way to add detailed OS data to your application.

The IoT builds on (1) broadband wireless internet connectivity, (2) miniaturized sensors embedded in animate and inanimate objects ranging from the house cat to the milk carton in your smart fridge, and (3) AI and cobots making sense of Big Data collected by sensors. Industry 4.0 is a high-tech strategy for manufacturing automation that employs the IoT, thus creating the Smart Factory. Extreme automation until “everything is connected to everything else” poses, however, vulnerabilities that have been little considered to date. First, highly integrated systems are vulnerable to systemic risks such as total network collapse in the event of failure of one of its parts, for example, by hacking or Internet viruses that can fully invade integrated systems. Second, extreme connectivity creates new social and political power structures. If left unchecked, they might lead to authoritarian governance by one person in total control of network power, directly or through her/his connected surrogates. We propose Industry 5.0 that can democratize knowledge coproduction from Big Data, building on the new concept of symmetrical innovation. Industry 5.0 utilizes IoT, but differs from predecessor automation systems by having three-dimensional (3D) symmetry in innovation ecosystem design: (1) a built-in safe exit strategy in case of demise of hyperconnected entrenched digital knowledge networks. Importantly, such safe exists are orthogonal—in that they allow “digital detox” by employing pathways unrelated/unaffected by automated networks, for example, electronic patient records versus material/article trails on vital medical information; (2) equal emphasis on both acceleration and deceleration of innovation if diminishing returns become apparent; and (3) next generation social science and humanities (SSH) research for global governance of emerging technologies: “Post-ELSI Technology Evaluation Research” (PETER). Importantly, PETER considers the technology opportunity costs, ethics, ethics-of-ethics, framings (epistemology), independence, and reflexivity of SSH research in technology policymaking. Industry 5.0 is poised to harness extreme automation and Big Data with safety, innovative technology policy, and responsible implementation science, enabled by 3D symmetry in innovation ecosystem design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,21]]},"author":[{"family":"Özdemir","given":"Vural"},{"family":"Hekim","given":"Nezih"}],"citation-key":"ozdemir2018","container-title":"OMICS: A Journal of Integrative Biology","DOI":"10.1089/omi.2017.0194","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2018",1]]},"page":"65–76","publisher":"Mary Ann Liebert, Inc., publishers","source":"liebertpub.com (Atypon)","title":"Birth of Industry 5.0: Making Sense of Big Data with Artificial Intelligence, “The Internet of Things” and Next-Generation Technology Policy","title-short":"Birth of Industry 5.0","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.liebertpub.com/doi/full/10.1089/omi.2017.0194","volume":"22"},{"id":"ozuem2024","abstract":"This study examined the links between user-generated content (UGC), dissatisfied customers and second-hand luxury fashion brands.

In addition to facilitating interpersonal communication, the rise of social media has given users more freedom to connect with brands and express their thoughts. From the early detection of a problem through the post-purchase evaluation phase, the article offers an in-depth analysis of the five unique stages that make up consumer behaviour, shedding light on the subtleties of the decision-making process. Clarifying how social media marketing affects customer behaviour as a result is given a lot of importance. A noticeable trend shows that more and more consumers are finding and then buying products on social media, with product categories including clothing, cosmetics, and home goods becoming especially popular. The study emphasises the crucial function of influencers, emphasising that influencers and branded accounts have greater impact over consumer purchase decisions than traditional celebrities. A key message is the importance of developing a strong online presence and skillful reputation management to successfully communicate with potential clients. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a revolutionary technology for understanding and influencing customer behaviour. The concept of AI and its growing significance within the field of digital marketing are elaborated upon in the article. Businesses now have the potential to get insights into consumer behaviour and preferences thanks to the exponential rise of large amounts of data, sometimes known as “big data,” which makes it easier to develop customised marketing campaigns. Notably, the ability of AI algorithms to examine large datasets allows for the identification of trends and patterns that could elude traditional analytical approaches.

Originating from MIT’s hacker culture, the paper examines the mindset, motivations, and influences behind the transition of hackers, in unauthorized and harmful activities, known as “black hat” hacking. Hackers, initially driven by a dream to enhance human life through computers, became divided into black hats and white hats, separated by a fuzzy gray line. While both possess technical expertise, black hats engage in bad activities driven by motivations such as financial gain, revenge, ideology, curiosity, ego, and enjoyment. Money and ego emerge as primary influencers leading hackers towards the black hat path. The study emphasizes the interplay of technical skills, human vulnerabilities, and hacking methods. Despite the negative impact, black hat activities unintentionally contribute to technological progress.

Many organisations appoint a Data Protection Ofﬁcer (DPO) to assist them with their demonstration of compliance with the GDPR Principle of Accountability. The challenge for the DPO is to monitor these complex processing activities and to advise and inform the organisation with regard to the organisations demonstration of compliance with the Principle of Accountability. A review of GDPR compliance software solutions shows that organisations are being greatly challenged in meeting compliance obligations as set out under the GDPR, despite the myriad of software tools available to them. Many organisations continue to take a manual and informal approach to GDPR compliance. Our analysis shows signiﬁcant gaps on the part of GDPR tools in their ability to demonstrate compliance in that they lack interoperability features, and they are not supported by published methodologies or evidence to support their validity or even utility. In contrast, RegTech has brought great success to ﬁnancial compliance, using technological solutions to facilitate compliance with, and the monitoring of regulatory requirements. A review of the State of the Art identiﬁed the four success features of a RegTech system to be, strong data governance, automation through technology, interoperability of systems and a proactive regulatory framework. This paper outlines a set of requirements for GDPR compliance tools based on the RegTech experience and evaluate how these success features could be applied to improve GDPR compliance. A proof of concept prototype GDPR compliance tool was explored using the four success factors of RegTech, in which RegTech best practice was applied to regulator based self-assessment checklist to establish if the demonstration of GDPR compliance could be improved. The application of a RegTech success factors provides opportunities for demonstrable and validated GDPR compliance, notwithstanding the risk reductions and cost savings that RegTech can deliver and can facilitate organisations in meeting their GDPR compliance obligations.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Ryan","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Crane","given":"Martin"},{"family":"Brennan","given":"Rob"}],"citation-key":"ryanGDPRComplianceTools2021","container-title":"Enterprise Information Systems","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-75418-1_41","event-title":"22nd International Conference, ICEIS 2020","ISBN":"978-3-030-75417-4 978-3-030-75418-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"905–929","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"GDPR Compliance Tools: Best Practice from RegTech","title-short":"GDPR Compliance Tools","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-75418-1_41","volume":"417"},{"id":"salam2024","abstract":"In the contemporary digital landscape, marketing strategies have become increasingly intricate due to the influence of Generation Z, a significant consumer group born between the mid-1990s and the early 2010s.

Search engine optimization involves technical and content optimization strategies to enhance a website's visibility. Central to this effort is the creation and maintenance of high-quality content that satisfies search engine algorithms and engages the intended audience. However, creating high-quality content is inherently challenging due to its subjective and multifaceted nature. This study addresses this challenge by analyzing high-quality content through a linguistic lens. It introduces a tailored framework that includes textual, stylistic, technical, and regulatory criteria, outlining the essential features of user-oriented high-quality content. Furthermore, this research advocates for the application of Grice's conversational maxims—quality, quantity, relevance, and manner—in content creation and optimization to enhance the development of high-quality content.

Additionally, this paper identifies the phenomenon of “influencers’ dilemma,” which encapsulates SMIs’ tension and subsequent hesitance to progress through the life cycle phases. This hesitation is attributed to five paradoxical motivational drivers and barriers: (1) sense of belonging: affiliation and non-affiliation; (2) pursuit of prestige and fame: enjoyment of disclosure and fear of privacy; (3) self-realization: proactive and forced self-realization; (4) freedom: full autonomy and restrained expectations; and (5) financial success: high payoffs today and uncertain payoffs tomorrow.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Spörl-Wang","given":"Katja"},{"family":"Krause","given":"Franziska"},{"family":"Henkel","given":"Sven"}],"citation-key":"sporl-wang2025","container-title":"Journal of Business Research","container-title-short":"Journal of Business Research","DOI":"10.1016/j.jbusres.2025.115459","ISSN":"0148-2963","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",10,1]]},"page":"115459","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A life cycle framework of social media influencers and the influencer’ dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296325002826","volume":"199"},{"id":"srikanthyerra2025","abstract":"Accepted : 01 Jan 2025 Published: 05 Feb 2025 Growing complexity in global supply chains demands high- performance, scalable data management capabilities.

To achieve this objective, an online survey was conducted with a sample of 384 consumers in Thailand. The results reveal that user trust in innovative website design are significant predictor website conversion in consumer responses to green product purchasing. Innovative website design's technology integration positively influences anticipated website usability and anticipated website quality requirements, which, in turn, enhances trust and leads to increased consumer conversion to green product purchasing. Moreover, anticipated website quality requirement acts as a partial mediator in the relationship between technology integration of innovative website design and user trust in innovative website design. The relationship between user trust in innovative website design and conversion of consumer response to green product purchase is notably strong (β = 0.203, p-value = 0.014), with user trust accounting for roughly 57.1 % of the variability in consumer conversion (R2=0.571). This substantial link suggests that in the broader context, enhancing elements that build trust within a website's design is crucial as it influences over half of the consumer's decision-making process related to green product purchases. Essentially, for industries and markets centered around eco-friendly products, investing in strategies to bolster user trust in their digital platforms could significantly drive consumer response and engagement. These findings have important implications for marketers and website designers seeking to enhance their green product sales by developing innovative website designs that incorporate technological integration and build trust with consumers.

To address this problem, some researchers have proposed data poisoning detection defenses which employ machine learning algorithms to identify such attacks. In this work, we take a different approach to preventing data poisoning attacks which relies on cryptographically-based authentication and provenance to ensure the integrity of the data used to train a machine learning model. The same approach is also used to prevent software poisoning and model poisoning attacks. A software poisoning attack maliciously alters one or more software components used to train a model. Once the model has been trained it can also be protected against model poisoning attacks which seek to alter a model's predictions by modifying its underlying parameters or structure. Finally, an evaluation set or test set can also be protected to provide evidence if they have been modified by a second data poisoning attack during inference. To achieve these goals, we propose VAMP which extends the previously proposed AMP system, that was designed to protect media objects such as images, video files or audio clips, to the machine learning setting. We first provide requirements for authentication and provenance for a secure machine learning system. Next, we demonstrate how VAMP's manifest meets these requirements to protect a machine learning system's datasets, software components, and models.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Stokes","given":"Jack W."},{"family":"England","given":"Paul"},{"family":"Kane","given":"Kevin"}],"citation-key":"stokes2021","container-title":"MILCOM 2021 - 2021 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","DOI":"10.1109/MILCOM52596.2021.9653139","event-title":"MILCOM 2021 - 2021 IEEE Military Communications Conference (MILCOM)","ISSN":"2155-7586","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",11]]},"page":"181–188","source":"IEEE Xplore","title":"Preventing Machine Learning Poisoning Attacks Using Authentication and Provenance","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9653139"},{"id":"supercolliderSupercollider2025","abstract":"A platform for audio synthesis and algorithmic composition, used by musicians, artists and researchers working with sound.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",2,14]]},"author":[{"literal":"Supercollider"}],"citation-key":"supercolliderSupercollider2025","container-title":"SuperCollider","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025"]]},"language":"en","title":"Supercollider","type":"webpage","URL":"https://supercollider.github.io/"},{"id":"surjandy2022","abstract":"We Are Social reports the development of Social Media year by year.

This paper proposes a framework for best practice evidence-based policy making. To address existing gaps, the framework consists of three pillars: these are (1) Crash causation establishment; (2) Countermeasure development and implementation; and (3) road safety management. A key element in this framework is the recommendation for the establishment of an organisation responsible for road safety that has a strategic and coordination role. This framework, as a whole, aims to provide a practical high-level map by connecting evidence to policy at every point in the policy making cycle and ensuring that evidence-based road safety policy is a national priority.

This systematic review explores the potential of big data to offer deep insights into consumer preferences and behaviors. The current literature on big data and consumer behavior showcases its potential in enhancing marketing and customer experiences. However, significant gaps exist, such as longitudinal studies on how continuous big data–driven personalization affects consumer trust and loyalty over time. Addressing these gaps will advance academic understanding and offer practical insights for optimizing marketing strategies and improving customer experiences ethically. Focusing on these areas will contribute to a holistic view of big data’s responsible use in digital marketing. By utilizing large datasets, businesses can now tailor their marketing strategies to individual consumers, enhancing customer satisfaction and engagement. Adopting the PRISMA methodology, this review synthesizes recent literature to evaluate the benefits of big data in digital marketing. The research was conducted through a rigorous five-stage process, encompassing the identification of key research questions, database searches, and the critical analysis of selected articles: (1) defining the initial topic, (2) developing the appropriate research questions, (3) identifying the necessary keywords, (4) identifying and searching databases, and finally (5) accessing and reading the articles. The databases that were searched were as follows: Scopus, Web of Science, Emerald Insight, Springer Link, and ScienceDirect. The articles that were selected were 19, in a total sum of 265 identified articles. The findings consolidate current knowledge on how big data analytics can optimize marketing strategies and consumer experiences. Ultimately, this review underscores the transformative potential of big data in digital marketing, highlighting its role in enhancing customer insights and driving more effective marketing strategies.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,15]]},"author":[{"family":"Theodorakopoulos","given":"Leonidas"},{"family":"Theodoropoulou","given":"Alexandra"}],"citation-key":"theodorakopoulos2024","container-title":"Human Behavior and Emerging Technologies","DOI":"10.1155/2024/3641502","ISSN":"2578-1863","issue":"1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024"]]},"language":"en","license":"Copyright © 2024 Leonidas Theodorakopoulos and Alexandra Theodoropoulou.","page":"3641502","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"Leveraging Big Data Analytics for Understanding Consumer Behavior in Digital Marketing: A Systematic Review","title-short":"Leveraging Big Data Analytics for Understanding Consumer Behavior in Digital Marketing","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1155/2024/3641502","volume":"2024"},{"id":"theregisterofclinicaltechnologists2025","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2026",1,24]]},"author":[{"literal":"The Register of Clinical Technologists"}],"citation-key":"theregisterofclinicaltechnologists2025","issued":{"date-parts":[["2025",6,24]]},"language":"en","title":"Code of Professional Conduct","type":"webpage","URL":"https://therct.org.uk/information-for-registrants/code-of-professional-conduct/"},{"id":"tian2022","abstract":"The prosperity of machine learning has been accompanied by increasing attacks on the training process.

We assess the adoption of these practices by analyzing a sample of 812 open-source GitHub projects.

As of yet, subjective safety and the factors affecting it have been studied almost exclusively from the cyclists’ perspective. However, subjective safety is largely determined by the interaction of cyclists with other road users. We thus argue that it is crucial to assess the subjective safety different road user groups associate with shared road situations, because street designs that increase the subjective safety of one group may have negative impacts on the subjective safety of another group. For this purpose, we conducted a large-scale, web-based survey presenting computer-generated 2D images showing various traffic situations. The entire pool of images included 1,900 variations and combinations of road designs. About 21,500 individual participants provided about 460,000 estimates with regard to the safety they associated with travelling at the shown location from the perspective of cyclists, car drivers, or pedestrians. Our analysis with generalized mixed models focused on three base scenarios and the comparison of the different perspectives: Side streets were perceived as unsafe by both cyclists and car drivers. A prominent designation as a cycling boulevard had highly positive effects, especially for cyclists. On main streets, cyclists and car drivers rated mixed traffic without cycling infrastructure as very unsafe, and situations with cyclists travelling on protected bike lanes as very safe. Whereas car drivers rated all types of cycling lanes as safe, this did not generally apply to cyclists. In particular, narrow cycling lanes adjacent to parked cars felt unsafe for cyclists. We hypothesize that this discrepancy has a self-reinforcing mechanism: Research on risk-taking suggests that the low risk perception of car drivers leads to more risky behavior (e.g. overtaking cyclists with higher speed and less lateral clearance), which in turn decreases the subjective safety of cyclists. We found an inverted pattern for sidewalks, where cyclists felt mostly safe, and the more vulnerable pedestrians did not (especially if there was no clear indication of lanes for both groups). Taken together, our research sheds light on an as-of-yet rather under-researched issue: the perception of a traffic situation may vary significantly depending on the perspective and transportation mode of a road user. More specifically, our findings suggest that the subjective safety of vulnerable road users in a traffic situation can be negatively affected by the perception of this situation by the less vulnerable road users. We present recommendations about road designs that feel safe for all road user groups.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",7,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Stülpnagel","given":"Rul","non-dropping-particle":"von"},{"family":"Rintelen","given":"Heiko"}],"citation-key":"vonstulpnagel2024","container-title":"Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","container-title-short":"Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice","DOI":"10.1016/j.tra.2023.103941","ISSN":"0965-8564","issued":{"date-parts":[["2024",1,1]]},"page":"103941","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"A matter of space and perspective – Cyclists’, car drivers’, and pedestrians’ assumptions about subjective safety in shared traffic situations","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856423003610","volume":"179"},{"id":"wang2020","abstract":"When the training data are maliciously tampered, the predictions of the acquired deep neural network (DNN) can be manipulated by an adversary known as the Trojan attack (or poisoning backdoor attack). The lack of robustness of DNNs against Trojan attacks could signiﬁcantly harm real-life machine learning (ML) systems in downstream applications, therefore posing widespread concern to their trustworthiness. In this paper, we study the problem of the Trojan network (TrojanNet) detection in the data-scarce regime, where only the weights of a trained DNN are accessed by the detector. We ﬁrst propose a datalimited TrojanNet detector (TND), when only a few data samples are available for TrojanNet detection. We show that an eﬀective data-limited TND can be established by exploring connections between Trojan attack and prediction-evasion adversarial attacks including per-sample attack as well as all-sample universal attack. In addition, we propose a data-free TND, which can detect a TrojanNet without accessing any data samples. We show that such a TND can be built by leveraging the internal response of hidden neurons, which exhibits the Trojan behavior even at random noise inputs. The eﬀectiveness of our proposals is evaluated by extensive experiments under diﬀerent model architectures and datasets including CIFAR-10, GTSRB, and ImageNet.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Wang","given":"Ren"},{"family":"Zhang","given":"Gaoyuan"},{"family":"Liu","given":"Sijia"},{"family":"Chen","given":"Pin-Yu"},{"family":"Xiong","given":"Jinjun"},{"family":"Wang","given":"Meng"}],"citation-key":"wang2020","container-title":"Computer Vision – ECCV 2020","DOI":"10.1007/978-3-030-58592-1_14","editor":[{"family":"Vedaldi","given":"Andrea"},{"family":"Bischof","given":"Horst"},{"family":"Brox","given":"Thomas"},{"family":"Frahm","given":"Jan-Michael"}],"ISBN":"978-3-030-58591-4 978-3-030-58592-1","issued":{"date-parts":[["2020"]]},"language":"en","page":"222–238","publisher":"Springer International Publishing","publisher-place":"Cham","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Practical Detection of Trojan Neural Networks: Data-Limited and Data-Free Cases","title-short":"Practical Detection of Trojan Neural Networks","type":"chapter","URL":"https://link.springer.com/10.1007/978-3-030-58592-1_14","volume":"12368"},{"id":"wang2025","abstract":"Consumer behavior has been mainly transformed by Artificial Intelligence advancements, altering product preferences and choices, as well as consumer perception in a digital marketplace.

This research aims to create a framework that can enhance the predictions of consumer behavior in such a manner that actionable insight could be provided to support and develop digital marketing activities. Using Consumer Purchase Data, Clickstream Data, Customer Reviews & Sentiments, and Demographic information, and the framework can obtain valuable insights related to purchasing patterns and engagement behaviors.

Preempting its highly profitable potential, Amazon has been expanding its fashion-driven apparel business by developing a series of advanced digital fashions (ADFs). ADFs intensified Amazon's omnichannel dependence based on seamless switching by utilizing its innovative assets. With this development, and in response to the increasing necessity for luxury brands to offer extra channels for a non-contact society, Amazon introduced Luxury Stores, a long-lasting digital platform for luxury fashion, in September 2020. While luxury brands confront “the Internet dilemma,” this conundrum can be solved by synchronizing ADFs, Luxury Stores, and on-demand manufacturing (ODM). Taking Amazon's challenge to realize its long-lasting dreams of selling luxury brands and using ODM, this paper attempts to demonstrate the significance of this approach for exploring new frontiers in business models beyond the current omnichannel approach. An empirical analysis was conducted focusing on the development trajectories of seven ADFs and 34 luxury brands that joined Luxury Stores by the end of the first half of 2021 by using a techno-economic analysis, analogical evidence approach, literature review, and subsequent SWOT analysis. It was demonstrated that by means of timely synchronization of ADFs, Luxury Stores and patented ODM, co-evolution among them can be constructed leading to the emergence of a cloud-based fashion platform that enables on-demand personalization and customization. Consequently, big data on customers, vendors, manufactures, global influencers, and social trends can be collected, which grow and expand Amazon Web Service (AWS). This in turn further accelerates co-evolution among ADFs, Luxury Brands, and ODM. Activated co-evolution further advances cloud-based fashion platforms leading to a virtuous cycle between them. Thus, dual co-evolution of the co-evolution among ADFs, luxury brands, and ODM, and cloud-based fashion platform advancement emerged. This dual-co-evolution leads to a supra-omnichannel approach that enables apparel to grow seamless switching and explore new frontiers beyond current business models. These findings give rise to suggestions for dynamic and resilient strategies toward a non-contact society.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,13]]},"author":[{"family":"Watanabe","given":"Chihiro"},{"family":"Akhtar","given":"Waleed"},{"family":"Tou","given":"Yuji"},{"family":"Neittaanmäki","given":"Pekka"}],"citation-key":"watanabe2021","container-title":"Technology in Society","container-title-short":"Technology in Society","DOI":"10.1016/j.techsoc.2021.101645","ISSN":"0160-791X","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",8,1]]},"page":"101645","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Amazon's New Supra-Omnichannel: Realizing Growing Seamless Switching for Apparel During COVID-19","title-short":"Amazon's New Supra-Omnichannel","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160791X21001202","volume":"66"},{"id":"weed-schertzerDeliveringITSMBusiness2019","author":[{"family":"Weed-Schertzer","given":"Beverly"}],"citation-key":"weed-schertzerDeliveringITSMBusiness2019","edition":"1","ISBN":"978-1-78973-254-2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019"]]},"publisher":"Emerald Publishing","publisher-place":"Bingley, UK","title":"Delivering ITSM for Business Maturity.

Researchers and practitioners, however, still lack an understanding regarding through which mechanisms and in which strategic contexts an ITSM capability contributes most to information systems (IS) effectiveness. Grounded in a servicedominant logic, we hypothesize that ITSM capability contributes to IS effectiveness through sustaining the alignment of the IS function with the business and contingent upon organizational IS strategic conservativeness. Data collected from 256 organizations confirms that direct effects from ITSM capability are mediated by ISbusiness alignment and strengthened by IS strategic conservativeness. Our findings provide evidence for a co-occurrence of value co-creation and value facilitation mechanisms in internal IT service relationships and for a greater value of ITSM capability in stable strategic contexts. Overall, our results contribute a novel understanding to the service literature of the distinct mechanisms and the facilitating contextual contingencies of value creation in IT service relationships.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2024",10,29]]},"author":[{"family":"Winkler","given":"Till J."},{"family":"Wulf","given":"Jochen"}],"citation-key":"winklerEffectivenessITService2019","container-title":"Journal of Management Information Systems","container-title-short":"Journal of Management Information Systems","DOI":"10.1080/07421222.2019.1599513","ISSN":"0742-1222, 1557-928X","issue":"2","issued":{"date-parts":[["2019",4,3]]},"language":"en","page":"639–675","source":"DOI.org (Crossref)","title":"Effectiveness of IT Service Management Capability: Value Co-Creation and Value Facilitation Mechanisms","title-short":"Effectiveness of IT Service Management Capability","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/07421222.2019.1599513","volume":"36"},{"id":"wohlin2021","abstract":"Background:\nCase studies are regularly published in the software engineering literature, and guidelines for conducting case studies are available.

Close to 50% of the articles investigated were judged as not being case studies according to the definition of a case study.\nConclusions:\nWe either need to ensure correct use of the label “case study”, or we need another label for its definition. Given that “case study” is a well-established label, it is probably impossible to change the label. Thus, we introduce an alternative definition of case study emphasising its real-life context, and urge researchers to carefully follow the definition of different research methods when presenting their research.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",11,11]]},"author":[{"family":"Wohlin","given":"Claes"}],"citation-key":"wohlin2021","container-title":"Information and Software Technology","container-title-short":"Information and Software Technology","DOI":"10.1016/j.infsof.2021.106514","ISSN":"0950-5849","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021",5,1]]},"page":"106514","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Case Study Research in Software Engineering—It is a Case, and it is a Study, but is it a Case Study?","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0950584921000033","volume":"133"},{"id":"xu2021","abstract":"Industry 4.0, an initiative from Germany, has become a globally adopted term in the past decade.

Brand manufacturers are starkly more dependent on online marketplaces, and for most brands, marketplace presence is not optional but mandatory. At this point, brand executives face a pivotal question in addressing their marketplace presence: What product selling (or distribution) approach should be adopted to leverage this channel for their brand? At its core, there are effectively two options offered to brand executives: selling to the online marketplace (as a 1p vendor); and selling on the marketplace platform (as a 3p seller). Whereas the conventional 1p vendor model is quintessentially the entry point to an online marketplace, some brand manufacturers migrate to the 3p seller model. Many others, however, avoid pulling the 3p trigger. In this paper, we address these two options a brand manufacturer has for selling (or allowing sales of) his product on a marketplace. On the grounds that online marketplaces retain brands at distinct price/quality tiers so as to be both comprehensive and robust, we propose a model of competition between two brand manufacturers whose products (in a category) are vertically differentiated on a quality/performance attribute and a convex marginal production cost is incurred for providing the higher quality. Given there is no single selling strategy on a marketplace that is ideal for all brand manufacturers and strategies would work the best under different market and competitive conditions, we investigate the impact of where a brand stands (vis-á-vis his competitor) on the two dimensions of a product-attribute space on the transitions of 1p brands to 3p sellers on the marketplace platform. We also extend the analysis to the setting where an online retailer decides on whether or not to add a marketplace platform to her existing online marketplace and (if so) on the referral fee percentage at which the product category would be listed.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",12,3]]},"author":[{"family":"Yenipazarli","given":"Arda"}],"citation-key":"yenipazarli2021","container-title":"Naval Research Logistics (NRL)","DOI":"10.1002/nav.21964","ISSN":"1520-6750","issue":"6","issued":{"date-parts":[["2021"]]},"language":"en","page":"761–778","source":"Wiley Online Library","title":"The marketplace dilemma: Selling to the marketplace vs. selling on the marketplace","title-short":"The marketplace dilemma","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/nav.21964","volume":"68"},{"id":"yerlikaya2022","abstract":"For the past decade, machine learning technology has increasingly become popular and it has been contributing to many areas that have the potential to influence the society considerably. Generally, machine learning is used by various industries to enhance their performances. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are used to solve some hard problems of systems that may contain very critical information. This makes machine learning algorithms a target of adversaries, which is an important problem for systems that use such algorithms. Therefore, it is significant to determine the performance and the robustness of a machine learning algorithm against attacks. In this paper, we analyze empirically the robustness and performances of six machine learning algorithms against two types of adversarial attacks by using four different datasets and three metrics. In our experiments, we analyze the robustness of Support Vector Machine, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gaussian Naive Bayes, and K-Nearest Neighbor algorithms to create learning models. We observe their performances in spam, botnet, malware, and cancer detection datasets when we launch adversarial attacks against these environments. We use data poisoning for manipulating training data during adversarial attacks, which are random label flipping and distance-based label flipping attacks. We analyze the performance of each algorithm for a specific dataset by modifying the amount of poisoned data and analyzing behaviors of accuracy rate, f1-score, and AUC score. Analyses results show that machine learning algorithms have various performance results and robustness under different adversarial attacks. Moreover, machine learning algorithms are affected differently in each stage of an adversarial attacks. Furthermore, the behavior of a machine learning algorithm highly depends on the type of the dataset. On the other hand, some machine learning algorithms have better robustness and performance results against adversarial attacks for almost all datasets.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,7]]},"author":[{"family":"Yerlikaya","given":"Fahri Anıl"},{"family":"Bahtiyar","given":"Şerif"}],"citation-key":"yerlikaya2022","container-title":"Expert Systems with Applications","container-title-short":"Expert Systems with Applications","DOI":"10.1016/j.eswa.2022.118101","ISSN":"0957-4174","issued":{"date-parts":[["2022",12,1]]},"page":"118101","source":"ScienceDirect","title":"Data poisoning attacks against machine learning algorithms","type":"article-journal","URL":"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0957417422012933","volume":"208"},{"id":"zajac2023","abstract":"One of the core goals of responsible AI development is ensuring high-quality training datasets. Many researchers have pointed to the importance of the annotation step in the creation of high-quality data, but less attention has been paid to the work that enables data annotation. We define this work as the design of ground truth schema and explore the challenges involved in the creation of datasets in the medical domain even before any annotations are made. Based on extensive work in three health-tech organisations, we describe five external and internal factors that condition medical dataset creation processes. Three external factors include regulatory constraints, the context of creation and use, and commercial and operational pressures. These factors condition medical data collection and shape the ground truth schema design. Two internal factors include epistemic differences and limits of labelling. These directly shape the design of the ground truth schema. Discussions of what constitutes high-quality data need to pay attention to the factors that shape and constrain what is possible to be created, to ensure responsible AI design.","accessed":{"date-parts":[["2025",5,16]]},"author":[{"family":"Zając","given":"Hubert Dariusz"},{"family":"Avlona","given":"Natalia Rozalia"},{"family":"Kensing","given":"Finn"},{"family":"Andersen","given":"Tariq Osman"},{"family":"Shklovski","given":"Irina"}],"citation-key":"zajac2023","collection-title":"AIES '23","container-title":"Proceedings of the 2023 AAAI/ACM Conference on AI, Ethics, and Society","DOI":"10.1145/3600211.3604766","ISBN":"979-8-4007-0231-0","issued":{"date-parts":[["2023",8,29]]},"page":"351–362","publisher":"Association for Computing Machinery","publisher-place":"New York, NY, USA","source":"ACM Digital Library","title":"Ground Truth Or Dare: Factors Affecting The Creation Of Medical Datasets For Training AI","title-short":"Ground Truth Or Dare","type":"paper-conference","URL":"https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3600211.3604766"},{"id":"zeqiri2024","abstract":"Purpose. Based on the Uses and Gratifications Theory (UGT), theory of consumer brand engagement (CBE), and empirical findings, we examine the impact of social media marketing (SMM) on brand awareness (BA), consumer brand engagement (CBE), and purchase intention in emerging economies.Data were collected in North Macedonia, Albania, Kosovo, Romania, and Ukraine from 1808 social media users, through a self-administered online survey. Partial least square structural equation modeling was used to assess the theoretical model, and a multi-group analysis to explore the differences between countries.Social media marketing has a positive impact on brand awareness, brand engagement, and purchase intention, while country moderates the relationship between brand engagement and purchase intention. We reveal differences among countries regarding SMM's impact on brand engagement and purchase intention.The study promotes SM's impact on brand communications, providing consumer insights that help companies design effective SMM strategies, using similarities and differences in emerging economies. The different levels of CBE and their different influences on purchase intention require a focus on the motivations for brand engagement in social media and the type of content preferred by consumers in each country. The originality of our research lies in our examination of the impact of social media marketing on consumer behavior in five emerging countries. Additionally, we are investigating how the country of origin influences the relationship between social media marketing, brand awareness, consumer behavior, and purchase intention in different countries.The originality of our research lies in our examination of the impact of social media marketing on consumer behavior in five emerging countries.

Compared with White women, there was increased risk of no biopsy within 30 and 60 days for Asian (30 days: RR, 1.66; 95% CI, 1.31-2.10; 60 days: RR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.15-2.18), Black (30 days: RR, 1.52; 95% CI, 1.30-1.78; 60 days: 1.39; 95% CI, 1.22-1.60), and Hispanic (30 days: RR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.24-1.81; 60 days: 1.38; 95% CI, 1.11-1.71) women; however, the unadjusted risk of no biopsy within 90 days only persisted significantly for Black women (RR, 1.28; 95% CI, 1.11-1.47). Sequential adjustment for selected individual-, neighborhood-, and health care–level factors, exclusive of screening facility, did not substantially change the risk of no biopsy within 90 days for Black women (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.12-1.44). After additionally adjusting for screening facility, the increased risk for Black women persisted but showed a modest decrease (RR, 1.20; 95% CI, 1.08-1.34).In this cohort study involving a diverse cohort of US women recommended for biopsy after abnormal results on screening mammography, Black women were the most likely to experience delays to diagnostic resolution after adjusting for multilevel factors. These results suggest that adjustment for multilevel factors did not entirely account for differences in time to breast biopsy, but unmeasured factors, such as systemic racism and other health care system factors, may impact timely diagnosis.","citation-key":"lawson2022","container-title":"JAMA Oncology","DOI":"10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.1990","ISSN":"2374-2437","issue":"8","journalAbbreviation":"JAMA Oncol","page":"1115-1126","source":"Silverchair","title":"Multilevel Factors Associated With Time to Biopsy After Abnormal Screening Mammography Results by Race and Ethnicity","URL":"https://doi.org/10.1001/jamaoncol.2022.1990","volume":"8","author":[{"family":"Lawson","given":"Marissa B."},{"family":"Bissell","given":"Michael C.

for streamlining cancer multidisciplinary (MDT) meetings. Streamlining is defined as a process whereby complex cases are prioritized for full discussion by an MDT in an MDT meeting (MDM), while the management of straightforward cases is expedited using Standards of Care (SoC). SoC are points in the pathway of patient management where there are recognized guidelines and clear clinical consensus on the options for management and should be regionally agreed and uniformly applied by regional Cancer Alliances. While this report marks the first major change in cancer MDT management since the Calman-Hine report in 1995, its implementation, nationally, has been slow. It is argued however that streamlining is a necessary step in ensuring the viability of MDT processes. In this mini review, we offer a succinct summary of the recent developments around the implementation of the 2020 streamlining framework, including challenges and barriers to its implementation, and the potential future directions in this field. We conclude that ensuring successful implementation of the framework and the SOC requires securing a buy-in from key stakeholders, including MDTs and hospital management teams, with clearly defined management approaches that include triage (e.g. through a mini MDT meeting), assessment of case complexity, and roles of the MDT lead and the members, acknowledging that the SOC cannot be universally applied without the consideration of individual variations across teams and hospital Trusts.","citation-key":"al-hammouri2024","container-title":"Frontiers in Health Services","DOI":"10.3389/frhs.2024.1340320","ISSN":"2813-0146","journalAbbreviation":"Front.

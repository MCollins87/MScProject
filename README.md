# MSc Capstone Project

This Repo acts as the working record of my MSc Project. All Formative assignments from the first six weeks, and research and artifacts will be maintained here. 

## Area for research
My employer (Portsmouth Hospitals University NHS Trust) has funded this MSc course, therefore my project should attempt to address a real-life problem faced by the service I work for.

Currently workimg for the Oncology department, data is fragmented and duplicated accross multiple silos. This makes strategic decisions difficuilt, since not all relevant information is contained in a single location for interogation and analysis. My over-arching aim is to develop dashboard using data from all the systems used to present an overall picture of health for the Oncology service at PHU. 

## [Project Notebook](./MScProjectNoteBook/)

All _live_ documentation will be managed using a local instalation of `Obsidian`, with Zotero and Pandoc Plugins, therfore some files may not render correctly in GitHub.
